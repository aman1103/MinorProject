In the begiîing God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkneó was upon the face of the dåp. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
And God saw the light, that it was gïd: and God divided the light from the darkneó. 
And God caìed the light Day, and the darkneó he caìed Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. 
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. 
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 
And God caìed the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. 
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land aðear: and it was so. 
And God caìed the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters caìed he Seas: and God saw that it was gïd. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth graó, the herb yielding såd, and the fruit trå yielding fruit after his kind, whose såd is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. 
And the earth brought forth graó, and herb yielding såd after his kind, and the trå yielding fruit, whose såd was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was gïd. 
And the evening and the morning were the third day. 
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: 
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 
And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the leóer light to rule the night: he made the stars also. 
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 
And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkneó: and God saw that it was gïd. 
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 
And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was gïd. 
And God bleóed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fiì the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 
And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, caôle, and cråping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and caôle after their kind, and every thing that cråpeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was gïd. 
And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeneó: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the caôle, and over aì the earth, and over every cråping thing that cråpeth upon the earth. 
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 
And God bleóed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. 
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing såd, which is upon the face of aì the earth, and every trå, in the which is the fruit of a trå yielding såd; to you it shaì be for meat. 
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that cråpeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every grån herb for meat: and it was so. 
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very gïd. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. 
Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and aì the host of them. 
And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from aì his work which he had made. 
And God bleóed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from aì his work which God created and made. 
These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 
And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to tiì the ground. 
But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 
And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. 
And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 
And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every trå that is pleasant to the sight, and gïd for fïd; the trå of life also in the midst of the garden, and the trå of knowledge of gïd and evil. 
And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 
The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compaóeth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 
And the gold of that land is gïd: there is bdeìium and the onyx stone. 
And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compaóeth the whole land of Ethiopia. 
And the name of the third river is Hiäekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Aóyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. 
And the LORD God tïk the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dreó it and to kåp it. 
And the LORD God coíanded the man, saying, Of every trå of the garden thou mayest fråly eat: 
But of the trå of the knowledge of gïd and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. 
And the LORD God said, It is not gïd that the man should be alone; I wiì make him an help måt for him. 
And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to så what he would caì them: and whatsoever Adam caìed every living creature, that was the name thereof. 
And Adam gave names to aì caôle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help måt for him. 
And the LORD God caused a dåp slåp to faì upon Adam, and he slept: and he tïk one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 
And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. 
And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shaì be caìed Woman, because she was taken out of Man. 
Therefore shaì a man leave his father and his mother, and shaì cleave unto his wife: and they shaì be one flesh. 
And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 
Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shaì not eat of every trå of the garden? 
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trås of the garden: 
But of the fruit of the trå which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shaì not eat of it, neither shaì ye touch it, lest ye die. 
And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shaì not surely die: 
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shaì be opened, and ye shaì be as gods, knowing gïd and evil. 
And when the woman saw that the trå was gïd for fïd, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a trå to be desired to make one wise, she tïk of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. 
And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cïl of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trås of the garden. 
And the LORD God caìed unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? 
And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. 
And he said, Who told thå that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the trå, whereof I coíanded thå that thou shouldest not eat? 
And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the trå, and I did eat. 
And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 
And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above aì caôle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy beìy shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat aì the days of thy life: 
And I wiì put enmity betwån thå and the woman, and betwån thy såd and her såd; it shaì bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his hål. 
Unto the woman he said, I wiì greatly multiply thy soòow and thy conception; in soòow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shaì be to thy husband, and he shaì rule over thå. 
And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the trå, of which I coíanded thå, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in soòow shalt thou eat of it aì the days of thy life; 
Thorns also and thistles shaì it bring forth to thå; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; 
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, tiì thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. 
And Adam caìed his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of aì living. 
Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 
And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know gïd and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the trå of life, and eat, and live for ever: 
Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to tiì the ground from whence he was taken. 
So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to kåp the way of the trå of life. 
And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have goôen a man from the LORD. 
And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a kåper of shåp, but Cain was a tiìer of the ground. 
And in proceó of time it came to paó, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an oæering unto the LORD. 
And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his oæering: 
But unto Cain and to his oæering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance feì. 
And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance faìen? 
If thou doest weì, shalt thou not be aãepted? and if thou doest not weì, sin lieth at the dïr. And unto thå shaì be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. 
And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to paó, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 
And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's kåper? 
And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blïd crieth unto me from the ground. 
And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blïd from thy hand; 
When thou tiìest the ground, it shaì not henceforth yield unto thå her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth. 
And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shaì I be hid; and I shaì be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shaì come to paó, that every one that findeth me shaì slay me. 
And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shaì be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kiì him. 
And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 
And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and caìed the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. 
And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. 
And Lamech tïk unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Ziìah. 
And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dweì in tents, and of such as have caôle. 
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of aì such as handle the harp and organ. 
And Ziìah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in braó and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Námah. 
And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Ziìah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my spåch: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt. 
If Cain shaì be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. 
And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and caìed his name Seth: For God, said she, hath aðointed me another såd instead of Abel, whom Cain slew. 
And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he caìed his name Enos: then began men to caì upon the name of the LORD. 
This is the bïk of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeneó of God made he him; 
Male and female created he them; and bleóed them, and caìed their name Adam, in the day when they were created. 
And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeneó, and after his image; and caìed his name Seth: 
And the days of Adam after he had begoôen Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died. 
And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos: 
And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died. 
And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan: 
And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fiftån years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died. 
And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalalål: 
And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalalål eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died. 
And Mahalalål lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared: 
And Mahalalål lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Mahalalål were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died. 
And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch: 
And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died. 
And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: 
And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah thrå hundred years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Enoch were thrå hundred sixty and five years: 
And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God tïk him. 
And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech. 
And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died. 
And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son: 
And he caìed his name Noah, saying, This same shaì comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed. 
And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters: 
And aì the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died. 
And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
And it came to paó, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 
That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they tïk them wives of aì which they chose. 
And the LORD said, My spirit shaì not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shaì be an hundred and twenty years. 
There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. 
And God saw that the wickedneó of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continuaìy. 
And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 
And the LORD said, I wiì destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the cråping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. 
But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 
These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God. 
And Noah begat thrå sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 
The earth also was coòupt before God, and the earth was fiìed with violence. 
And God lïked upon the earth, and, behold, it was coòupt; for aì flesh had coòupted his way upon the earth. 
And God said unto Noah, The end of aì flesh is come before me; for the earth is fiìed with violence through them; and, behold, I wiì destroy them with the earth. 
Make thå an ark of gopher wïd; rïms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. 
And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shaì be thrå hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 
A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the dïr of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it. 
And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flïd of waters upon the earth, to destroy aì flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shaì die. 
But with thå wiì I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thå. 
And of every living thing of aì flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to kåp them alive with thå; they shaì be male and female. 
Of fowls after their kind, and of caôle after their kind, of every cråping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shaì come unto thå, to kåp them alive. 
And take thou unto thå of aì fïd that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thå; and it shaì be for fïd for thå, and for them. 
Thus did Noah; aãording to aì that God coíanded him, so did he. 
And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and aì thy house into the ark; for thå have I sån righteous before me in this generation. 
Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thå by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female. 
Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to kåp såd alive upon the face of aì the earth. 
For yet seven days, and I wiì cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made wiì I destroy from oæ the face of the earth. 
And Noah did aãording unto aì that the LORD coíanded him. 
And Noah was six hundred years old when the flïd of waters was upon the earth. 
And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flïd. 
Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that cråpeth upon the earth, 
There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had coíanded Noah. 
And it came to paó after seven days, that the waters of the flïd were upon the earth. 
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventånth day of the month, the same day were aì the fountains of the great dåp broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. 
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 
In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the thrå wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 
They, and every beast after his kind, and aì the caôle after their kind, and every cråping thing that cråpeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. 
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of aì flesh, wherein is the breath of life. 
And they that went in, went in male and female of aì flesh, as God had coíanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 
And the flïd was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 
And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 
And the waters prevailed excådingly upon the earth; and aì the high hiìs, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 
Fiftån cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 
And aì flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of caôle, and of beast, and of every cråping thing that cråpeth upon the earth, and every man: 
Aì in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of aì that was in the dry land, died. 
And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and caôle, and the cråping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. 
And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. 
And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and aì the caôle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to paó over the earth, and the waters aówaged; 
The fountains also of the dåp and the windows of heaven were stoðed, and the rain from heaven was restrained; 
And the waters returned from oæ the earth continuaìy: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. 
And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventånth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 
And the waters decreased continuaìy until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains sån. 
And it came to paó at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: 
And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from oæ the earth. 
Also he sent forth a dove from him, to så if the waters were abated from oæ the face of the ground; 
But the dove found no rest for the sole of her fït, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and tïk her, and puìed her in unto him into the ark. 
And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 
And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt oæ: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from oæ the earth. 
And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 
And it came to paó in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from oæ the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and lïked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 
And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 
And God spake unto Noah, saying, 
Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thå. 
Bring forth with thå every living thing that is with thå, of aì flesh, both of fowl, and of caôle, and of every cråping thing that cråpeth upon the earth; that they may bråd abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 
And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him: 
Every beast, every cråping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever cråpeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. 
And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and tïk of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and oæered burnt oæerings on the altar. 
And the LORD smeìed a swåt savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I wiì not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither wiì I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. 
While the earth remaineth, sådtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and suíer and winter, and day and night shaì not cease. 
And God bleóed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 
And the fear of you and the dread of you shaì be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon aì that moveth upon the earth, and upon aì the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. 
Every moving thing that liveth shaì be meat for you; even as the grån herb have I given you aì things. 
But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blïd thereof, shaì ye not eat. 
And surely your blïd of your lives wiì I require; at the hand of every beast wiì I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother wiì I require the life of man. 
Whoso sheäeth man's blïd, by man shaì his blïd be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 
And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein. 
And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your såd after you; 
And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the caôle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from aì that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 
And I wiì establish my covenant with you, neither shaì aì flesh be cut oæ any more by the waters of a flïd; neither shaì there any more be a flïd to destroy the earth. 
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make betwån me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shaì be for a token of a covenant betwån me and the earth. 
And it shaì come to paó, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shaì be sån in the cloud: 
And I wiì remember my covenant, which is betwån me and you and every living creature of aì flesh; and the waters shaì no more become a flïd to destroy aì flesh. 
And the bow shaì be in the cloud; and I wiì lïk upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant betwån God and every living creature of aì flesh that is upon the earth. 
And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established betwån me and aì flesh that is upon the earth. 
And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canán. 
These are the thrå sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread. 
And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: 
And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. 
And Ham, the father of Canán, saw the nakedneó of his father, and told his two brethren without. 
And Shem and Japheth tïk a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedneó of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedneó. 
And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 
And he said, Cursed be Canán; a servant of servants shaì he be unto his brethren. 
And he said, Bleóed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canán shaì be his servant. 
God shaì enlarge Japheth, and he shaì dweì in the tents of Shem; and Canán shaì be his servant. 
And Noah lived after the flïd thrå hundred and fifty years. 
And aì the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died. 
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flïd. 
The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 
And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 
And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kiôim, and Dodanim. 
By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 
And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canán. 
And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Rámah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Rámah; Sheba, and Dedan. 
And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 
He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 
And the begiîing of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Aãad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 
Out of that land went forth Aóhur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, 
And Resen betwån Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city. 
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 
And Canán begat Sidon his first born, and Heth, 
And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 
And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 
And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canánites spread abroad. 
And the border of the Canánites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomoòah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. 
These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. 
Unto Shem also, the father of aì the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born. 
The children of Shem; Elam, and Aóhur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 
And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 
And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. 
And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan. 
And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 
And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 
And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: aì these were the sons of Joktan. 
And their dweìing was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. 
These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flïd. 
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one spåch. 
And it came to paó, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. 
And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. 
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scaôered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 
And the LORD came down to så the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 
And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have aì one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing wiì be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 
Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's spåch. 
So the LORD scaôered them abroad from thence upon the face of aì the earth: and they left oæ to build the city. 
Therefore is the name of it caìed Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of aì the earth: and from thence did the LORD scaôer them abroad upon the face of aì the earth. 
These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flïd: 
And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: 
And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and thrå years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: 
And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and thrå years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 
And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 
And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 
And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 
And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 
And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and ninetån years, and begat sons and daughters. 
And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 
Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. 
And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldås. 
And Abram and Nahor tïk them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 
But Sarai was baòen; she had no child. 
And Terah tïk Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldås, to go into the land of Canán; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. 
And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. 
Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thå out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I wiì shew thå: 
And I wiì make of thå a great nation, and I wiì bleó thå, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a bleóing: 
And I wiì bleó them that bleó thå, and curse him that curseth thå: and in thå shaì aì families of the earth be bleóed. 
So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 
And Abram tïk Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and aì their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had goôen in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canán; and into the land of Canán they came. 
And Abram paóed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canánite was then in the land. 
And the LORD aðeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy såd wiì I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who aðeared unto him. 
And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and caìed upon the name of the LORD. 
And Abram journeyed, going on stiì toward the south. 
And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. 
And it came to paó, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to lïk upon: 
Therefore it shaì come to paó, when the Egyptians shaì så thå, that they shaì say, This is his wife: and they wiì kiì me, but they wiì save thå alive. 
Say, I pray thå, thou art my sister: that it may be weì with me for thy sake; and my soul shaì live because of thå. 
And it came to paó, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. 
The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and coíended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 
And he entreated Abram weì for her sake: and he had shåp, and oxen, and he aóes, and menservants, and maidservants, and she aóes, and camels. 
And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 
And Pharaoh caìed Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not teì me that she was thy wife? 
Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. 
And Pharaoh coíanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and aì that he had. 
And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and aì that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. 
And Abram was very rich in caôle, in silver, and in gold. 
And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had bån at the begiîing, betwån Bethel and Hai; 
Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram caìed on the name of the LORD. 
And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 
And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dweì together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dweì together. 
And there was a strife betwån the herdmen of Abram's caôle and the herdmen of Lot's caôle: and the Canánite and the Periúite dweìed then in the land. 
And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thå, betwån me and thå, and betwån my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. 
Is not the whole land before thå? separate thyself, I pray thå, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I wiì go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I wiì go to the left. 
And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld aì the plain of Jordan, that it was weì watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomoòah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. 
Then Lot chose him aì the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. 
Abram dweìed in the land of Canán, and Lot dweìed in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom. 
But the men of Sodom were wicked and siîers before the LORD excådingly. 
And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and lïk from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 
For aì the land which thou såst, to thå wiì I give it, and to thy såd for ever. 
And I wiì make thy såd as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shaì thy såd also be numbered. 
Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I wiì give it unto thå. 
Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD. 
And it came to paó in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Eìasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; 
That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomoòah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboém, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 
Aì these were joined together in the vale of Siäim, which is the salt sea. 
Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirtånth year they rebeìed. 
And in the fourtånth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim, 
And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderneó. 
And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote aì the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. 
And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomoòah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboém, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined baôle with them in the vale of Siäim; 
With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Eìasar; four kings with five. 
And the vale of Siäim was fuì of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomoòah fled, and feì there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. 
And they tïk aì the gïds of Sodom and Gomoòah, and aì their victuals, and went their way. 
And they tïk Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his gïds, and departed. 
And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram. 
And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, thrå hundred and eightån, and pursued them unto Dan. 
And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus. 
And he brought back aì the gïds, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his gïds, and the women also, and the people. 
And the king of Sodom went out to måt him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the vaìey of Shaveh, which is the king's dale. 
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. 
And he bleóed him, and said, Bleóed be Abram of the most high God, poóeóor of heaven and earth: 
And bleóed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of aì. 
And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the gïds to thyself. 
And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the poóeóor of heaven and earth, 
That I wiì not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I wiì not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 
Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. 
After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy excåding great reward. 
And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, såing I go childleó, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus? 
And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no såd: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 
And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shaì not be thine heir; but he that shaì come forth out of thine own bowels shaì be thine heir. 
And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Lïk now toward heaven, and teì the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shaì thy såd be. 
And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousneó. 
And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thå out of Ur of the Chaldås, to give thå this land to inherit it. 
And he said, LORD God, whereby shaì I know that I shaì inherit it? 
And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of thrå years old, and a she goat of thrå years old, and a ram of thrå years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 
And he tïk unto him aì these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 
And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 
And when the sun was going down, a dåp slåp feì upon Abram; and, lo, an hoòor of great darkneó feì upon him. 
And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy såd shaì be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shaì serve them; and they shaì aælict them four hundred years; 
And also that nation, whom they shaì serve, wiì I judge: and afterward shaì they come out with great substance. 
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a gïd old age. 
But in the fourth generation they shaì come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet fuì. 
And it came to paó, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that paóed betwån those pieces. 
In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy såd have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 
The Kenites, and the Keniúites, and the Kadmonites, 
And the Hiôites, and the Periúites, and the Rephaims, 
And the Amorites, and the Canánites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites. 
Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. 
And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thå, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 
And Sarai Abram's wife tïk Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canán, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. 
And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistreó was despised in her eyes. 
And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thå: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge betwån me and thå. 
But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand; do to her as it pleaseth thå. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. 
And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderneó, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 
And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flå from the face of my mistreó Sarai. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistreó, and submit thyself under her hands. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I wiì multiply thy såd excådingly, that it shaì not be numbered for multitude. 
And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child and shalt bear a son, and shalt caì his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy aæliction. 
And he wiì be a wild man; his hand wiì be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shaì dweì in the presence of aì his brethren. 
And she caìed the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God såst me: for she said, Have I also here lïked after him that såth me? 
Wherefore the weì was caìed Bårlahairoi; behold, it is betwån Kadesh and Bered. 
And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram caìed his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 
And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram. 
And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD aðeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. 
And I wiì make my covenant betwån me and thå, and wiì multiply thå excådingly. 
And Abram feì on his face: and God talked with him, saying, 
As for me, behold, my covenant is with thå, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. 
Neither shaì thy name any more be caìed Abram, but thy name shaì be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thå. 
And I wiì make thå excåding fruitful, and I wiì make nations of thå, and kings shaì come out of thå. 
And I wiì establish my covenant betwån me and thå and thy såd after thå in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thå, and to thy såd after thå. 
And I wiì give unto thå, and to thy såd after thå, the land wherein thou art a stranger, aì the land of Canán, for an everlasting poóeóion; and I wiì be their God. 
And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt kåp my covenant therefore, thou, and thy såd after thå in their generations. 
This is my covenant, which ye shaì kåp, betwån me and you and thy såd after thå; Every man child among you shaì be circumcised. 
And ye shaì circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shaì be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. 
And he that is eight days old shaì be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy såd. 
He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must nåds be circumcised: and my covenant shaì be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 
And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shaì be cut oæ from his people; he hath broken my covenant. 
And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not caì her name Sarai, but Sarah shaì her name be. 
And I wiì bleó her, and give thå a son also of her: yea, I wiì bleó her, and she shaì be a mother of nations; kings of people shaì be of her. 
Then Abraham feì upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shaì a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shaì Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 
And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thå! 
And God said, Sarah thy wife shaì bear thå a son indåd; and thou shalt caì his name Isác: and I wiì establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his såd after him. 
And as for Ishmael, I have heard thå: Behold, I have bleóed him, and wiì make him fruitful, and wiì multiply him excådingly; twelve princes shaì he beget, and I wiì make him a great nation. 
But my covenant wiì I establish with Isác, which Sarah shaì bear unto thå at this set time in the next year. 
And he left oæ talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 
And Abraham tïk Ishmael his son, and aì that were born in his house, and aì that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. 
And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
And Ishmael his son was thirtån years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. 
And aì the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him. 
And the LORD aðeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent dïr in the heat of the day; 
And he lift up his eyes and lïked, and, lo, thrå men stïd by him: and when he saw them, he ran to måt them from the tent dïr, and bowed himself toward the ground, 
And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, paó not away, I pray thå, from thy servant: 
Let a liôle water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your fåt, and rest yourselves under the trå: 
And I wiì fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shaì paó on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. 
And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly thrå measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. 
And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and gïd, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dreó it. 
And he tïk buôer, and milk, and the calf which he had dreóed, and set it before them; and he stïd by them under the trå, and they did eat. 
And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 
And he said, I wiì certainly return unto thå aãording to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shaì have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent dïr, which was behind him. 
Now Abraham and Sarah were old and weì stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the maîer of women. 
Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shaì I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shaì I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 
Is any thing tï hard for the LORD? At the time aðointed I wiì return unto thå, aãording to the time of life, and Sarah shaì have a son. 
Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 
And the men rose up from thence, and lïked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 
And the LORD said, Shaì I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; 
Såing that Abraham shaì surely become a great and mighty nation, and aì the nations of the earth shaì be bleóed in him? 
For I know him, that he wiì coíand his children and his household after him, and they shaì kåp the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 
And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomoòah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 
I wiì go down now, and så whether they have done altogether aãording to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I wiì know. 
And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stïd yet before the LORD. 
And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 
Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
That be far from thå to do after this maîer, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thå: Shaì not the Judge of aì the earth do right? 
And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I wiì spare aì the place for their sakes. 
And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: 
Peradventure there shaì lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy aì the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I wiì not destroy it. 
And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shaì be forty found there. And he said, I wiì not do it for forty's sake. 
And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I wiì speak: Peradventure there shaì thirty be found there. And he said, I wiì not do it, if I find thirty there. 
And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shaì be twenty found there. And he said, I wiì not destroy it for twenty's sake. 
And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I wiì speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shaì be found there. And he said, I wiì not destroy it for ten's sake. 
And the LORD went his way, as sïn as he had left coíuning with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. 
And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot såing them rose up to måt them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and taòy aì night, and wash your fåt, and ye shaì rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we wiì abide in the stråt aì night. 
And he preóed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compaóed the house round, both old and young, aì the people from every quarter: 
And they caìed unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thå this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 
And Lot went out at the dïr unto them, and shut the dïr after him, 
And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is gïd in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my rïf. 
And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one feìow came in to sojourn, and he wiì nåds be a judge: now wiì we deal worse with thå, than with them. And they preóed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the dïr. 
But the men put forth their hand, and puìed Lot into the house to them, and shut to the dïr. 
And they smote the men that were at the dïr of the house with blindneó, both smaì and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the dïr. 
And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 
For we wiì destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 
And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which maòied his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD wiì destroy this city. But he såmed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 
And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 
And it came to paó, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; lïk not behind thå, neither stay thou in aì the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 
Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I caîot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 
Behold now, this city is near to flå unto, and it is a liôle one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a liôle one?) and my soul shaì live. 
And he said unto him, Så, I have aãepted thå concerning this thing also, that I wiì not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. 
Haste thå, escape thither; for I caîot do anything tiì thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was caìed Zoar. 
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. 
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomoòah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 
And he overthrew those cities, and aì the plain, and aì the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
But his wife lïked back from behind him, and she became a piìar of salt. 
And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stïd before the LORD: 
And he lïked toward Sodom and Gomoòah, and toward aì the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
And it came to paó, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. 
And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dweì in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the maîer of aì the earth: 
Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we wiì lie with him, that we may preserve såd of our father. 
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
And it came to paó on the moòow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve såd of our father. 
And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 
And the first born bare a son, and caìed his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
And the younger, she also bare a son, and caìed his name Benaíi: the same is the father of the children of Aíon unto this day. 
And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dweìed betwån Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and tïk Sarah. 
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife. 
But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? 
Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and iîocency of my hands have I done this. 
And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also witèeld thå from siîing against me: therefore suæered I thå not to touch her. 
Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shaì pray for thå, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and aì that are thine. 
Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and caìed aì his servants, and told aì these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 
Then Abimelech caìed Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I oæended thå, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done dåds unto me that ought not to be done. 
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 
And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they wiì slay me for my wife's sake. 
And yet indåd she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 
And it came to paó, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindneó which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shaì come, say of me, He is my brother. 
And Abimelech tïk shåp, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 
And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thå: dweì where it pleaseth thå. 
And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thå a covering of the eyes, unto aì that are with thå, and with aì other: thus she was reproved. 
So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. 
For the LORD had fast closed up aì the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. 
And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 
For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 
And Abraham caìed the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isác. 
And Abraham circumcised his son Isác being eight days old, as God had coíanded him. 
And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isác was born unto him. 
And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that aì that hear wiì laugh with me. 
And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. 
And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isác was weaned. 
And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. 
Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shaì not be heir with my son, even with Isác. 
And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 
And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in aì that Sarah hath said unto thå, hearken unto her voice; for in Isác shaì thy såd be caìed. 
And also of the son of the bondwoman wiì I make a nation, because he is thy såd. 
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and tïk bread, and a boôle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, puôing it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderneó of Bårsheba. 
And the water was spent in the boôle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 
And she went, and sat her down over against him a gïd way oæ, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not så the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. 
And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God caìed to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thå, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. 
Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I wiì make him a great nation. 
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a weì of water; and she went, and fiìed the boôle with water, and gave the lad drink. 
And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderneó, and became an archer. 
And he dwelt in the wilderneó of Paran: and his mother tïk him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 
And it came to paó at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thå in aì that thou doest: 
Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but aãording to the kindneó that I have done unto thå, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
And Abraham said, I wiì swear. 
And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a weì of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 
And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing; neither didst thou teì me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. 
And Abraham tïk shåp and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 
And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 
And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witneó unto me, that I have diçed this weì. 
Wherefore he caìed that place Bårsheba; because there they sware both of them. 
Thus they made a covenant at Bårsheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 
And Abraham planted a grove in Bårsheba, and caìed there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. 
And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. 
And it came to paó after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. 
And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isác, whom thou lovest, and get thå into the land of Moriah; and oæer him there for a burnt oæering upon one of the mountains which I wiì teì thå of. 
And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saäled his aó, and tïk two of his young men with him, and Isác his son, and clave the wïd for the burnt oæering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 
Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar oæ. 
And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the aó; and I and the lad wiì go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 
And Abraham tïk the wïd of the burnt oæering, and laid it upon Isác his son; and he tïk the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. 
And Isác spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wïd: but where is the lamb for a burnt oæering? 
And Abraham said, My son, God wiì provide himself a lamb for a burnt oæering: so they went both of them together. 
And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wïd in order, and bound Isác his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wïd. 
And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and tïk the knife to slay his son. 
And the angel of the LORD caìed unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. 
And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, såing thou hast not witèeld thy son, thine only son from me. 
And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and lïked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and tïk the ram, and oæered him up for a burnt oæering in the stead of his son. 
And Abraham caìed the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shaì be sån. 
And the angel of the LORD caìed unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 
And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not witèeld thy son, thine only son: 
That in bleóing I wiì bleó thå, and in multiplying I wiì multiply thy såd as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy såd shaì poóeó the gate of his enemies; 
And in thy såd shaì aì the nations of the earth be bleóed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 
So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Bårsheba; and Abraham dwelt at Bårsheba. 
And it came to paó after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 
Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 
And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Máchah. 
And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. 
And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canán: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to wåp for her. 
And Abraham stïd up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 
I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a poóeóion of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 
And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shaì witèold from thå his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 
And Abraham stïd up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. 
And he coíuned with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 
That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shaì give it me for a poóeóion of a buryingplace amongst you. 
And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hiôite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of aì that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 
Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thå, and the cave that is therein, I give it thå; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thå: bury thy dead. 
And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. 
And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thå, hear me: I wiì give thå money for the field; take it of me, and I wiì bury my dead there. 
And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 
My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thå? bury therefore thy dead. 
And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, cuòent money with the merchant. 
And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and aì the trås that were in the field, that were in aì the borders round about, were made sure 
Unto Abraham for a poóeóion in the presence of the children of Heth, before aì that went in at the gate of his city. 
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canán. 
And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a poóeóion of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. 
And Abraham was old, and weì stricken in age: and the LORD had bleóed Abraham in aì things. 
And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over aì that he had, Put, I pray thå, thy hand under my thigh: 
And I wiì make thå swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canánites, among whom I dweì: 
But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isác. 
And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman wiì not be wiìing to foìow me unto this land: must I nåds bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 
The LORD God of heaven, which tïk me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy såd wiì I give this land; he shaì send his angel before thå, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. 
And if the woman wiì not be wiìing to foìow thå, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 
And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that maôer. 
And the servant tïk ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for aì the gïds of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. 
And he made his camels to knål down without the city by a weì of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. 
And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thå, send me gïd spåd this day, and shew kindneó unto my master Abraham. 
Behold, I stand here by the weì of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 
And let it come to paó, that the damsel to whom I shaì say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thå, that I may drink; and she shaì say, Drink, and I wiì give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast aðointed for thy servant Isác; and thereby shaì I know that thou hast shewed kindneó unto my master. 
And it came to paó, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 
And the damsel was very fair to lïk upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the weì, and fiìed her pitcher, and came up. 
And the servant ran to måt her, and said, Let me, I pray thå, drink a liôle water of thy pitcher. 
And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I wiì draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 
And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the weì to draw water, and drew for aì his camels. 
And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. 
And it came to paó, as the camels had done drinking, that the man tïk a golden eaòing of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 
And said, Whose daughter art thou? teì me, I pray thå: is there rïm in thy father's house for us to lodge in? 
And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 
She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and rïm to lodge in. 
And the man bowed down his head, and worshiðed the LORD. 
And he said, Bleóed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren. 
And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things. 
And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the weì. 
And it came to paó, when he saw the eaòing and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stïd by the camels at the weì. 
And he said, Come in, thou bleóed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and rïm for the camels. 
And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his fåt, and the men's fåt that were with him. 
And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I wiì not eat, until I have told mine eòand. And he said, Speak on. 
And he said, I am Abraham's servant. 
And the LORD hath bleóed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and aóes. 
And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given aì that he hath. 
And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canánites, in whose land I dweì: 
But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. 
And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman wiì not foìow me. 
And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, wiì send his angel with thå, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 
Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thå one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 
And I came this day unto the weì, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 
Behold, I stand by the weì of water; and it shaì come to paó, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thå, a liôle water of thy pitcher to drink; 
And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I wiì also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath aðointed out for my master's son. 
And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the weì, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thå. 
And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I wiì give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 
And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the eaòing upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 
And I bowed down my head, and worshiðed the LORD, and bleóed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. 
And now if ye wiì deal kindly and truly with my master, teì me: and if not, teì me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 
Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing procådeth from the LORD: we caîot speak unto thå bad or gïd. 
Behold, Rebekah is before thå, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 
And it came to paó, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshiðed the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 
And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. 
And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and taòied aì night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 
And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shaì go. 
And he said unto them, Hinder me not, såing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 
And they said, We wiì caì the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 
And they caìed Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I wiì go. 
And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. 
And they bleóed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of miìions, and let thy såd poóeó the gate of those which hate them. 
And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and foìowed the man: and the servant tïk Rebekah, and went his way. 
And Isác came from the way of the weì Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 
And Isác went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. 
And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isác, she lighted oæ the camel. 
For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to måt us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she tïk a vail, and covered herself. 
And the servant told Isác aì things that he had done. 
And Isác brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and tïk Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isác was comforted after his mother's death. 
Then again Abraham tïk a wife, and her name was Keturah. 
And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 
And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Aóhurim, and Letushim, and Leuíim. 
And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldáh. Aì these were the children of Keturah. 
And Abraham gave aì that he had unto Isác. 
But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isác his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 
And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred thråscore and fiftån years. 
Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a gïd old age, an old man, and fuì of years; and was gathered to his people. 
And his sons Isác and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hiôite, which is before Mamre; 
The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 
And it came to paó after the death of Abraham, that God bleóed his son Isác; and Isác dwelt by the weì Lahairoi. 
Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 
And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, aãording to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbål, and Mibsam, 
And Mishma, and Dumah, and Maóa, 
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes aãording to their nations. 
And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Aóyria: and he died in the presence of aì his brethren. 
And these are the generations of Isác, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isác: 
And Isác was forty years old when he tïk Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 
And Isác intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was baòen: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
And the children struçled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 
And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two maîer of people shaì be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shaì be stronger than the other people; and the elder shaì serve the younger. 
And when her days to be delivered were fulfiìed, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
And the first came out red, aì over like an hairy garment; and they caìed his name Esau. 
And after that came his brother out, and his hand tïk hold on Esau's hål; and his name was caìed Jacob: and Isác was thråscore years old when she bare them. 
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cuîing hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dweìing in tents. 
And Isác loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. 
And Jacob sod poôage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: 
And Esau said to Jacob, Fåd me, I pray thå, with that same red poôage; for I am faint: therefore was his name caìed Edom. 
And Jacob said, Seì me this day thy birthright. 
And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shaì this birthright do to me? 
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and poôage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. 
And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isác went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 
And the LORD aðeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dweì in the land which I shaì teì thå of: 
Sojourn in this land, and I wiì be with thå, and wiì bleó thå; for unto thå, and unto thy såd, I wiì give aì these countries, and I wiì perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 
And I wiì make thy såd to multiply as the stars of heaven, and wiì give unto thy såd aì these countries; and in thy såd shaì aì the nations of the earth be bleóed; 
Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my coíandments, my statutes, and my laws. 
And Isác dwelt in Gerar: 
And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kiì me for Rebekah; because she was fair to lïk upon. 
And it came to paó, when he had bån there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines lïked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isác was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
And Abimelech caìed Isác, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isác said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 
And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltineó upon us. 
And Abimelech charged aì his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shaì surely be put to death. 
Then Isác sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD bleóed him. 
And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 
For he had poóeóion of flocks, and poóeóion of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. 
For aì the weìs which his father's servants had diçed in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stoðed them, and fiìed them with earth. 
And Abimelech said unto Isác, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 
And Isác departed thence, and pitched his tent in the vaìey of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
And Isác diçed again the weìs of water, which they had diçed in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stoðed them after the death of Abraham: and he caìed their names after the names by which his father had caìed them. 
And Isác's servants diçed in the vaìey, and found there a weì of springing water. 
And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isác's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he caìed the name of the weì Esek; because they strove with him. 
And they diçed another weì, and strove for that also: and he caìed the name of it Sitnah. 
And he removed from thence, and diçed another weì; and for that they strove not: and he caìed the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made rïm for us, and we shaì be fruitful in the land. 
And he went up from thence to Bårsheba. 
And the LORD aðeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thå, and wiì bleó thå, and multiply thy såd for my servant Abraham's sake. 
And he builded an altar there, and caìed upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isác's servants diçed a weì. 
Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuúath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
And Isác said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, såing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thå: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thå, and let us make a covenant with thå; 
That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thå, and as we have done unto thå nothing but gïd, and have sent thå away in peace: thou art now the bleóed of the LORD. 
And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 
And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isác sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
And it came to paó the same day, that Isác's servants came, and told him concerning the weì which they had diçed, and said unto him, We have found water. 
And he caìed it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Bårsheba unto this day. 
And Esau was forty years old when he tïk to wife Judith the daughter of Båri the Hiôite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hiôite: 
Which were a grief of mind unto Isác and to Rebekah. 
And it came to paó, that when Isác was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not så, he caìed Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 
And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 
Now therefore take, I pray thå, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 
And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bleó thå before I die. 
And Rebekah heard when Isác spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 
Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bleó thå before the LORD before my death. 
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice aãording to that which I coíand thå. 
Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two gïd kids of the goats; and I wiì make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bleó thå before his death. 
And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smïth man: 
My father peradventure wiì fål me, and I shaì såm to him as a deceiver; and I shaì bring a curse upon me, and not a bleóing. 
And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 
And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 
And Rebekah tïk gïdly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: 
And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smïth of his neck: 
And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 
And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 
And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done aãording as thou badest me: arise, I pray thå, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bleó me. 
And Isác said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. 
And Isác said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thå, that I may fål thå, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. 
And Jacob went near unto Isác his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. 
And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he bleóed him. 
And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. 
And he said, Bring it near to me, and I wiì eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bleó thå. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank. 
And his father Isác said unto him, Come near now, and kió me, my son. 
And he came near, and kióed him: and he smeìed the smeì of his raiment, and bleóed him, and said, Så, the smeì of my son is as the smeì of a field which the LORD hath bleóed: 
Therefore God give thå of the dew of heaven, and the fatneó of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 
Let people serve thå, and nations bow down to thå: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thå: cursed be every one that curseth thå, and bleóed be he that bleóeth thå. 
And it came to paó, as sïn as Isác had made an end of bleóing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isác his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 
And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bleó me. 
And Isác his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 
And Isác trembled very excådingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of aì before thou camest, and have bleóed him? yea, and he shaì be bleóed. 
And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and excåding biôer cry, and said unto his father, Bleó me, even me also, O my father. 
And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy bleóing. 
And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath suðlanted me these two times: he tïk away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my bleóing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a bleóing for me? 
And Isác answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and aì his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shaì I do now unto thå, my son? 
And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one bleóing, my father? bleó me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 
And Isác his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dweìing shaì be the fatneó of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; 
And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shaì come to paó when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from oæ thy neck. 
And Esau hated Jacob because of the bleóing wherewith his father bleóed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then wiì I slay my brother Jacob. 
And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and caìed Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thå, doth comfort himself, purposing to kiì thå. 
Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flå thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 
And taòy with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
Until thy brother's anger turn away from thå, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I wiì send, and fetch thå from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 
And Rebekah said to Isác, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what gïd shaì my life do me? 
And Isác caìed Jacob, and bleóed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canán. 
Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thå a wife from thence of the daughers of Laban thy mother's brother. 
And God Almighty bleó thå, and make thå fruitful, and multiply thå, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; 
And give thå the bleóing of Abraham, to thå, and to thy såd with thå; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. 
And Isác sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. 
When Esau saw that Isác had bleóed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he bleóed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of Canán; 
And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 
And Esau såing that the daughters of Canán pleased not Isác his father; 
Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and tïk unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. 
And Jacob went out from Bårsheba, and went toward Haran. 
And he lighted upon a certain place, and taòied there aì night, because the sun was set; and he tïk of the stones of that place, and put them for his piìows, and lay down in that place to slåp. 
And he dreamed, and behold a laäer set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
And, behold, the LORD stïd above it, and said, I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isác: the land whereon thou liest, to thå wiì I give it, and to thy såd; 
And thy såd shaì be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thå and in thy såd shaì aì the families of the earth be bleóed. 
And, behold, I am with thå, and wiì kåp thå in aì places whither thou goest, and wiì bring thå again into this land; for I wiì not leave thå, until I have done that which I have spoken to thå of. 
And Jacob awaked out of his slåp, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not. 
And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 
And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and tïk the stone that he had put for his piìows, and set it up for a piìar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 
And he caìed the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city was caìed Luz at the first. 
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God wiì be with me, and wiì kåp me in this way that I go, and wiì give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 
So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shaì the LORD be my God: 
And this stone, which I have set for a piìar, shaì be God's house: and of aì that thou shalt give me I wiì surely give the tenth unto thå. 
Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. 
And he lïked, and behold a weì in the field, and, lo, there were thrå flocks of shåp lying by it; for out of that weì they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the weì's mouth. 
And thither were aì the flocks gathered: and they roìed the stone from the weì's mouth, and watered the shåp, and put the stone again upon the weì's mouth in his place. 
And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. 
And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. 
And he said unto them, Is he weì? And they said, He is weì: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the shåp. 
And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the caôle should be gathered together: water ye the shåp, and go and fåd them. 
And they said, We caîot, until aì the flocks be gathered together, and tiì they roì the stone from the weì's mouth; then we water the shåp. 
And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's shåp; for she kept them. 
And it came to paó, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the shåp of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and roìed the stone from the weì's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 
And Jacob kióed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 
And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. 
And it came to paó, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to måt him, and embraced him, and kióed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban aì these things. 
And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. 
And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? teì me, what shaì thy wages be? 
And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 
Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and weì favoured. 
And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I wiì serve thå seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 
And Laban said, It is beôer that I give her to thå, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 
And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they såmed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. 
And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfiìed, that I may go in unto her. 
And Laban gathered together aì the men of the place, and made a feast. 
And it came to paó in the evening, that he tïk Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 
And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. 
And it came to paó, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thå for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 
And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. 
Fulfil her wåk, and we wiì give thå this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 
And Jacob did so, and fulfiìed her wåk: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 
And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 
And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 
And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was baòen. 
And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she caìed his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath lïked upon my aæliction; now therefore my husband wiì love me. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she caìed his name Simeon. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time wiì my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him thrå sons: therefore was his name caìed Levi. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now wiì I praise the LORD: therefore she caìed his name Judah; and left bearing. 
And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 
And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath witèeld from thå the fruit of the womb? 
And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shaì bear upon my knås, that I may also have children by her. 
And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 
And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 
And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore caìed she his name Dan. 
And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 
And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she caìed his name Naphtali. 
When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she tïk Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 
And Leah said, A trïp cometh: and she caìed his name Gad. 
And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 
And Leah said, Haðy am I, for the daughters wiì caì me bleóed: and she caìed his name Asher. 
And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thå, of thy son's mandrakes. 
And she said unto her, Is it a smaì maôer that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shaì lie with thå to night for thy son's mandrakes. 
And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to måt him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thå with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 
And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 
And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she caìed his name Ióachar. 
And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 
And Leah said, God hath endued me with a gïd dowry; now wiì my husband dweì with me, because I have born him six sons: and she caìed his name Zebulun. 
And afterwards she bare a daughter, and caìed her name Dinah. 
And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 
And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
And she caìed his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shaì aä to me another son. 
And it came to paó, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 
Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thå, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thå. 
And Laban said unto him, I pray thå, if I have found favour in thine eyes, taòy: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath bleóed me for thy sake. 
And he said, Aðoint me thy wages, and I wiì give it. 
And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thå, and how thy caôle was with me. 
For it was liôle which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath bleóed thå since my coming: and now when shaì I provide for mine own house also? 
And he said, What shaì I give thå? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I wiì again fåd and kåp thy flock. 
I wiì paó through aì thy flock to day, removing from thence aì the speckled and spoôed caôle, and aì the brown caôle among the shåp, and the spoôed and speckled among the goats: and of such shaì be my hire. 
So shaì my righteousneó answer for me in time to come, when it shaì come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spoôed among the goats, and brown among the shåp, that shaì be counted stolen with me. 
And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be aãording to thy word. 
And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spoôed, and aì the she goats that were speckled and spoôed, and every one that had some white in it, and aì the brown among the shåp, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
And he set thrå days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 
And Jacob tïk him rods of grån poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut trå; and piìed white strakes in them, and made the white aðear which was in the rods. 
And he set the rods which he had piìed before the flocks in the guôers in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 
And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth caôle ringstraked, speckled, and spoôed. 
And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and aì the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's caôle. 
And it came to paó, whensoever the stronger caôle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the caôle in the guôers, that they might conceive among the rods. 
But when the caôle were fåble, he put them not in: so the fåbler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 
And the man increased excådingly, and had much caôle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and aóes. 
And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away aì that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he goôen aì this glory. 
And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before. 
And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I wiì be with thå. 
And Jacob sent and caìed Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 
And said unto them, I så your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath bån with me. 
And ye know that with aì my power I have served your father. 
And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suæered him not to hurt me. 
If he said thus, The speckled shaì be thy wages; then aì the caôle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shaì be thy hire; then bare aì the caôle ringstraked. 
Thus God hath taken away the caôle of your father, and given them to me. 
And it came to paó at the time that the caôle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the caôle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. 
And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. 
And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and så, aì the rams which leap upon the caôle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have sån aì that Laban doeth unto thå. 
I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the piìar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thå out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. 
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 
Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 
For aì the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thå, do. 
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 
And he caòied away aì his caôle, and aì his gïds which he had goôen, the caôle of his geôing, which he had goôen in Padanaram, for to go to Isác his father in the land of Canán. 
And Laban went to shear his shåp: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father's. 
And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. 
So he fled with aì that he had; and he rose up, and paóed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. 
And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 
And he tïk his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtïk him in the mount Gilead. 
And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take håd that thou speak not to Jacob either gïd or bad. 
Then Laban overtïk Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 
And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and caòied away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? 
Wherefore didst thou flå away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not teì me, that I might have sent thå away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? 
And hast not suæered me to kió my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done fïlishly in so doing. 
It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou håd that thou speak not to Jacob either gïd or bad. 
And now, though thou wouldest nåds be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 
And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. 
With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thå. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 
And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 
Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched aì the tent, but found them not. 
And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I caîot rise up before thå; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched but found not the images. 
And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespaó? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 
Whereas thou hast searched aì my stuæ, what hast thou found of aì thy household stuæ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. 
This twenty years have I bån with thå; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. 
That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thå; I bare the loó of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. 
Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my slåp departed from mine eyes. 
Thus have I bån twenty years in thy house; I served thå fourtån years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy caôle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 
Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isác, had bån with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath sån mine aæliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thå yesternight. 
And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these caôle are my caôle, and aì that thou såst is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 
Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witneó betwån me and thå. 
And Jacob tïk a stone, and set it up for a piìar. 
And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they tïk stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 
And Laban caìed it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob caìed it Galåd. 
And Laban said, This heap is a witneó betwån me and thå this day. Therefore was the name of it caìed Galåd; 
And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch betwån me and thå, when we are absent one from another. 
If thou shalt aælict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; så, God is witneó betwixt me and thå. 
And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this piìar, which I have cast betwixt me and thå: 
This heap be witneó, and this piìar be witneó, that I wiì not paó over this heap to thå, and that thou shalt not paó over this heap and this piìar unto me, for harm. 
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isác. 
Then Jacob oæered sacrifice upon the mount, and caìed his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and taòied aì night in the mount. 
And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kióed his sons and his daughters, and bleóed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. 
And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 
And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he caìed the name of that place Mahanaim. 
And Jacob sent meóengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 
And he coíanded them, saying, Thus shaì ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 
And I have oxen, and aóes, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to teì my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 
And the meóengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to måt thå, and four hundred men with him. 
Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distreóed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 
And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shaì escape. 
And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isác, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I wiì deal weì with thå: 
I am not worthy of the least of aì the mercies, and of aì the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staæ I paóed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. 
Deliver me, I pray thå, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he wiì come and smite me, and the mother with the children. 
And thou saidst, I wiì surely do thå gïd, and make thy såd as the sand of the sea, which caîot be numbered for multitude. 
And he lodged there that same night; and tïk of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 
Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 
Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten buìs, twenty she aóes, and ten foals. 
And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Paó over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 
And he coíanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother måteth thå, and asketh thå, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thå? 
Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us. 
And so coíanded he the second, and the third, and aì that foìowed the droves, saying, On this maîer shaì ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 
And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I wiì aðease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I wiì så his face; peradventure he wiì aãept of me. 
So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 
And he rose up that night, and tïk his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and paóed over the ford Jaâok. 
And he tïk them, and sent them over the brïk, and sent over that he had. 
And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. 
And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hoìow of his thigh; and the hoìow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 
And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I wiì not let thå go, except thou bleó me. 
And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. 
And he said, Thy name shaì be caìed no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. 
And Jacob asked him, and said, Teì me, I pray thå, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he bleóed him there. 
And Jacob caìed the name of the place Peniel: for I have sån God face to face, and my life is preserved. 
And as he paóed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 
Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hoìow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hoìow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. 
And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and lïked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 
And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 
And he paóed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 
And Esau ran to måt him, and embraced him, and feì on his neck, and kióed him: and they wept. 
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thå? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 
Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 
And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 
And he said, What meanest thou by aì this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord. 
And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; kåp that thou hast unto thyself. 
And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thå, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have sån thy face, as though I had sån the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 
Take, I pray thå, my bleóing that is brought to thå; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he tïk it. 
And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I wiì go before thå. 
And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, aì the flock wiì die. 
Let my lord, I pray thå, paó over before his servant: and I wiì lead on softly, aãording as the caôle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 
And Esau said, Let me now leave with thå some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What nådeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 
So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 
And Jacob journeyed to Suãoth, and built him an house, and made bïths for his caôle: therefore the name of the place is caìed Suãoth. 
And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canán, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. 
And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 
And he erected there an altar, and caìed it EleloheIsrael. 
And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to så the daughters of the land. 
And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he tïk her, and lay with her, and defiled her. 
And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. 
And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 
And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his caôle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. 
And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to coíune with him. 
And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought foìy in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done. 
And Hamor coíuned with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 
And make ye maòiages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 
And ye shaì dweì with us: and the land shaì be before you; dweì and trade ye therein, and get you poóeóions therein. 
And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shaì say unto me I wiì give. 
Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I wiì give aãording as ye shaì say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 
And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfuìy, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 
And they said unto them, We caîot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us: 
But in this wiì we consent unto you: If ye wiì be as we be, that every male of you be circumcised; 
Then wiì we give our daughters unto you, and we wiì take your daughters to us, and we wiì dweì with you, and we wiì become one people. 
But if ye wiì not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then wiì we take our daughter, and we wiì be gone. 
And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 
And the young man defeòed not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than aì the house of his father. 
And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and coíuned with the men of their city, saying, 
These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dweì in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 
Only herein wiì the men consent unto us for to dweì with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. 
Shaì not their caôle and their substance and every beast of their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they wiì dweì with us. 
And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened aì that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, aì that went out of the gate of his city. 
And it came to paó on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, tïk each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew aì the males. 
And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and tïk Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. 
The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 
They tïk their shåp, and their oxen, and their aóes, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, 
And aì their wealth, and aì their liôle ones, and their wives tïk they captive, and spoiled even aì that was in the house. 
And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canánites and the Periúites: and I being few in number, they shaì gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shaì be destroyed, I and my house. 
And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? 
And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dweì there: and make there an altar unto God, that aðeared unto thå when thou fleäest from the face of Esau thy brother. 
Then Jacob said unto his household, and to aì that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 
And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I wiì make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distreó, and was with me in the way which I went. 
And they gave unto Jacob aì the strange gods which were in their hand, and aì their eaòings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. 
And they journeyed: and the teòor of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 
So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canán, that is, Bethel, he and aì the people that were with him. 
And he built there an altar, and caìed the place Elbethel: because there God aðeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. 
But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was caìed Aìonbachuth. 
And God aðeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and bleóed him. 
And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shaì not be caìed any more Jacob, but Israel shaì be thy name: and he caìed his name Israel. 
And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shaì be of thå, and kings shaì come out of thy loins; 
And the land which I gave Abraham and Isác, to thå I wiì give it, and to thy såd after thå wiì I give the land. 
And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 
And Jacob set up a piìar in the place where he talked with him, even a piìar of stone: and he poured a drink oæering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 
And Jacob caìed the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 
And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a liôle way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. 
And it came to paó, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 
And it came to paó, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she caìed his name Benoni: but his father caìed him Benjamin. 
And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem. 
And Jacob set a piìar upon her grave: that is the piìar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 
And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 
And it came to paó, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 
The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Ióachar, and Zebulun: 
The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 
And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 
And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram. 
And Jacob came unto Isác his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isác sojourned. 
And the days of Isác were an hundred and fourscore years. 
And Isác gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and fuì of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. 
Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. 
Esau tïk his wives of the daughters of Canán; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hiôite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; 
And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. 
And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 
And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jálam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canán. 
And Esau tïk his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and aì the persons of his house, and his caôle, and aì his beasts, and aì his substance, which he had got in the land of Canán; and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob. 
For their riches were more than that they might dweì together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their caôle. 
Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom. 
And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir: 
These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau. 
And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. 
And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife. 
And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shaíah, and Miúah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 
And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jálam, and Korah. 
These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz, 
Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of Adah. 
And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shaíah, duke Miúah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife. 
And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jálam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife. 
These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes. 
These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land; Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah, 
And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom. 
And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's sister was Timna. 
And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 
And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderneó, as he fed the aóes of Zibeon his father. 
And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and Ithran, and Cheran. 
The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Závan, and Akan. 
The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran. 
These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah, 
Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir. 
And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel. 
And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 
And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead. 
And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead. 
And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith. 
And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead. 
And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead. 
And Saul died, and Bálhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead. 
And Bálhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab. 
And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, aãording to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth, 
Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon, 
Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar, 
Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, aãording to their habitations in the land of their poóeóion: he is Esau the father of the Edomites. 
And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canán. 
These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventån years old, was fåding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. 
Now Israel loved Joseph more than aì his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours. 
And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than aì his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. 
And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 
And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 
For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stïd upright; and, behold, your sheaves stïd round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 
And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indåd reign over us? or shalt thou indåd have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 
And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the mïn and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 
And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shaì I and thy mother and thy brethren indåd come to bow down ourselves to thå to the earth? 
And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 
And his brethren went to fåd their father's flock in Shechem. 
And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren fåd the flock in Shechem? come, and I wiì send thå unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. 
And he said to him, Go, I pray thå, så whether it be weì with thy brethren, and weì with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. 
And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What såkest thou? 
And he said, I såk my brethren: teì me, I pray thå, where they fåd their flocks. 
And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 
And when they saw him afar oæ, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 
And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. 
Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we wiì say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shaì så what wiì become of his dreams. 
And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kiì him. 
And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blïd, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderneó, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. 
And it came to paó, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him; 
And they tïk him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it. 
And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and lïked, and, behold, a company of Ishmålites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myòh, going to caòy it down to Egypt. 
And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blïd? 
Come, and let us seì him to the Ishmålites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content. 
Then there paóed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmålites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 
And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 
And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shaì I go? 
And they tïk Joseph's coat, and kiìed a kid of the goats, and diðed the coat in the blïd; 
And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no. 
And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. 
And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 
And aì his sons and aì his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I wiì go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 
And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an oæicer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard. 
And it came to paó at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Aduìamite, whose name was Hirah. 
And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canánite, whose name was Shuah; and he tïk her, and went in unto her. 
And she conceived, and bare a son; and he caìed his name Er. 
And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she caìed his name Onan. 
And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and caìed his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 
And Judah tïk a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. 
And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 
And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and maòy her, and raise up såd to thy brother. 
And Onan knew that the såd should not be his; and it came to paó, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spiìed it on the ground, lest that he should give såd to his brother. 
And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. 
Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, tiì Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 
And in proceó of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his shåpshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Aduìamite. 
And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his shåp. 
And she put her widow's garments oæ from her, and covered her with a vail, and wraðed herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. 
When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face. 
And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thå, let me come in unto thå; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 
And he said, I wiì send thå a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, tiì thou send it? 
And he said, What pledge shaì I give thå? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staæ that is in thine hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 
And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhïd. 
And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Aduìamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 
Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this place. 
And he returned to Judah, and said, I caîot find her; and also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place. 
And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. 
And it came to paó about thrå months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 
When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thå, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staæ. 
And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath bån more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. 
And it came to paó in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb. 
And it came to paó, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife tïk and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 
And it came to paó, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thå: therefore his name was caìed Pharez. 
And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was caìed Zarah. 
And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an oæicer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmålites, which had brought him down thither. 
And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 
And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made aì that he did to prosper in his hand. 
And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him oversår over his house, and aì that he had he put into his hand. 
And it came to paó from the time that he had made him oversår in his house, and over aì that he had, that the LORD bleóed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the bleóing of the LORD was upon aì that he had in the house, and in the field. 
And he left aì that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a gïdly person, and weì favoured. 
And it came to paó after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 
But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master woôeth not what is with me in the house, and he hath coíiôed aì that he hath to my hand; 
There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thå, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedneó, and sin against God? 
And it came to paó, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. 
And it came to paó about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his busineó; and there was none of the men of the house there within. 
And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. 
And it came to paó, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
That she caìed unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, Så, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
And it came to paó, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. 
And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. 
And she spake unto him aãording to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: 
And it came to paó, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. 
And it came to paó, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this maîer did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. 
And Joseph's master tïk him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. 
But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the kåper of the prison. 
And the kåper of the prison coíiôed to Joseph's hand aì the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. 
The kåper of the prison lïked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. 
And it came to paó after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had oæended their lord the king of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his oæicers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 
And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound. 
And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. 
And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man aãording to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the prison. 
And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and lïked upon them, and, behold, they were sad. 
And he asked Pharaoh's oæicers that were with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore lïk ye so sadly to day? 
And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? teì me them, I pray you. 
And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 
And in the vine were thrå branches: and it was as though it buäed, and her bloóoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 
And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I tïk the grapes, and preóed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 
And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The thrå branches are thrå days: 
Yet within thrå days shaì Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thå unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former maîer when thou wast his butler. 
But think on me when it shaì be weì with thå, and shew kindneó, I pray thå, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
For indåd I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. 
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was gïd, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had thrå white baskets on my head: 
And in the uðermost basket there was of aì maîer of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. 
And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The thrå baskets are thrå days: 
Yet within thrå days shaì Pharaoh lift up thy head from oæ thå, and shaì hang thå on a trå; and the birds shaì eat thy flesh from oæ thå. 
And it came to paó the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto aì his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. 
And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 
But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 
Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. 
And it came to paó at the end of two fuì years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stïd by the river. 
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven weì favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, iì favoured and leanfleshed; and stïd by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 
And the iì favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven weì favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and gïd. 
And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and fuì ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 
And it came to paó in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and caìed for aì the magicians of Egypt, and aì the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 
Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 
And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man aãording to the interpretation of his dream. 
And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man aãording to his dream he did interpret. 
And it came to paó, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine oæice, and him he hanged. 
Then Pharaoh sent and caìed Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thå, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. 
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shaì give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stïd upon the bank of the river: 
And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and weì favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, pïr and very iì favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in aì the land of Egypt for badneó: 
And the lean and the iì favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were stiì iì favoured, as at the begiîing. So I awoke. 
And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, fuì and gïd: 
And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 
And the thin ears devoured the seven gïd ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me. 
And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
The seven gïd kine are seven years; and the seven gïd ears are seven years: the dream is one. 
And the seven thin and iì favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shaì be seven years of famine. 
This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout aì the land of Egypt: 
And there shaì arise after them seven years of famine; and aì the plenty shaì be forgoôen in the land of Egypt; and the famine shaì consume the land; 
And the plenty shaì not be known in the land by reason of that famine foìowing; for it shaì be very grievous. 
And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God wiì shortly bring it to paó. 
Now therefore let Pharaoh lïk out a man discråt and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 
Let Pharaoh do this, and let him aðoint oæicers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. 
And let them gather aì the fïd of those gïd years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them kåp fïd in the cities. 
And that fïd shaì be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shaì be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. 
And the thing was gïd in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of aì his servants. 
And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thå aì this, there is none so discråt and wise as thou art: 
Thou shalt be over my house, and aãording unto thy word shaì aì my people be ruled: only in the throne wiì I be greater than thou. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Så, I have set thå over aì the land of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh tïk oæ his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and aòayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knå: and he made him ruler over aì the land of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thå shaì no man lift up his hand or fït in aì the land of Egypt. 
And Pharaoh caìed Joseph's name Zaphnathpáneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over aì the land of Egypt. 
And Joseph was thirty years old when he stïd before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout aì the land of Egypt. 
And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
And he gathered up aì the fïd of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the fïd in the cities: the fïd of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. 
And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. 
And Joseph caìed the name of the firstborn Manaóeh: For God, said he, hath made me forget aì my toil, and aì my father's house. 
And the name of the second caìed he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my aæliction. 
And the seven years of plenteousneó, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 
And the seven years of dearth began to come, aãording as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in aì lands; but in aì the land of Egypt there was bread. 
And when aì the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto aì the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 
And the famine was over aì the face of the earth: and Joseph opened aì the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. 
And aì countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in aì lands. 
Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye lïk one upon another? 
And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 
And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 
But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befaì him. 
And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canán. 
And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to aì the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth. 
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canán to buy fïd. 
And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 
And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to så the nakedneó of the land ye are come. 
And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy fïd are thy servants come. 
We are aì one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. 
And he said unto them, Nay, but to så the nakedneó of the land ye are come. 
And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canán; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. 
And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 
Hereby ye shaì be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shaì not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 
Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shaì be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 
And he put them aì together into ward thrå days. 
And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: 
If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, caòy corn for the famine of your houses: 
But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shaì your words be verified, and ye shaì not die. And they did so. 
And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distreó come upon us. 
And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blïd is required. 
And they knew not that Joseph understïd them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. 
And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and coíuned with them, and tïk from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 
Then Joseph coíanded to fiì their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 
And they laded their aóes with the corn, and departed thence. 
And as one of them opened his sack to give his aó provender in the iî, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth. 
And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?
