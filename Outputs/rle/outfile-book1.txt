DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK ­ AN INCIDENT
When Farmer Oak smiled, the corners of his mouth
spread tiì they were within an unimportant distance of
his ears, his eyes were reduced to chinks, and diverging
wrinkles aðeared round them, extending upon his
countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of
the rising sun.
His Christian name was Gabriel, and on working
days he was a young man of sound judgment, easy
motions, proper dreó, and general gïd character. On
Sundays he was a man of misty views, rather given to
postponing, and hampered by his best clothes and
umbreìa : upon the whole, one who felt himself to
oãupy moraìy that vast miäle space of Laodicean
neutrality which lay betwån the Coíunion people
of the parish and the drunken section, ­ that is, he went
to church, but yawned privately by the time the con+
gegation reached the Nicene cråd,- and thought of
what there would be for diîer when he meant to be
listening to the sermon. Or, to state his character as
it stïd in the scale of public opinion, when his friends
and critics were in tantrums, he was considered rather a
bad man ; when they were pleased, he was rather a gïd
man ; when they were neither, he was a man whose
moral colour was a kind of peðer-and-salt mixture.
Since he lived six times as many working-days as
Sundays, Oak's aðearance in his old clothes was most
peculiarly his own ­ the mental picture formed by his
neighbours in imagining him being always dreóed in
that way. He wore a low-crowned felt hat, spread out
at the base by tight jaíing upon the head for security
in high winds, and a coat like Dr. Johnson's ; his lower
extremities being encased in ordinary leather leçings
and bïts emphaticaìy large, aæording to each fït a
rïmy apartment so constructed that any wearer might
stand in a river aì day long and know nothing of
<P 52>
damp ­ their maker being a conscientious man who
endeavoured to compensate for any weakneó in his cut
by unstinted dimension and solidity.
Mr. Oak 'caòied 'about him, by way of watch,+
what may be caìed a smaì silver clock; in other
words, it was a watch as to shape and intention, and
a smaì clock as to size. This instrument being several
years older than Oak's grandfather, had the peculiarity
of going either tï fast or not at aì. The smaìer
of its hands, tï, oãasionaìy sliðed round on the
pivot, and thus, though the minutes were told with
precision, nobody could be quite certain of the hour
they belonged to. The stoðing peculiarity of his
watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes, and he
escaped any evil consequences from the other two
defects by constant comparisons with and observations
of the sun and stars, and by preóing his face close
to the glaó of his neighbours' windows, tiì he could
discern the hour marked by the grån-faced timekåpers
within. It may be mentioned that Oak's fob being
diæicult of aãeó, by reason of its somewhat high
situation in the waistband of his trousers (which also
lay at a remote height under his waistcoat), the watch
was as a neceóity puìed out by throwing the body to
one-side, compreóing the- mouth and face to a mere
maó of- ruäy flesh- on aãount -of the exertion, and
drawing up the watch by its chain, like a bucket from a
weì.
But some thoughtfuì persons, who had sån him
walking acroó one of his fields on a certain December
morning ­ suîy and excådingly mild ­ might have
regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these. In
his face one might notice that many of the hues and
curves of youth had taòied on to manhïd: there even
remained in his remoter craîies some relics of the boy.
His height and breadth would have bån suæicient to
make his presence imposing, had they bån exhibited
with due consideration. But there is a way some men
have, rural and urban alike, for which the mind is more
responsible than flesh and sinew : it is a way of curtail+
ing their dimensions by their maîer of showing them.
And from a quiet modesty that would have become a
vestal which såmed continuaìy to impreó upon him
<P 53>
that he had no great claim on the world's rïm, Oak
walked unaóumingly and with a faintly perceptible
bend, yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders.
This may be said to be a defect in an individual if he
depends for his valuation more upon his aðearance
than upon his capacity to wear weì, which Oak did not.
He had just reached the time of life at which " young'
is ceasing to be the prefix of "man ' in speaking of one.
He was at the brightest period of masculine growth,
for his inteìect and his emotions were clearly separated :
he had paóed the time during which the influence of
youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character
of impulse, and he had not yet aòived at the stage
wherein they become united again, in the character of
prejudice, by the influence of a wife and family. In
short, he was twenty-eight, and a bachelor.
The field he was in this morning sloped to a
ridge caìed Norcombe Hiì. Through a spur of this
hiì ran the highway betwån Eíinster and Chalk+
Newton. Casuaìy glancing over the hedge, Oak saw
coming down the incline before him an ornamental
spring waçon, painted yeìow and gaily marked,
drawn by two horses, a waçoner walking alongside
bearing a whip perpendicularly. The waçon was
laden with household gïds and window plants, and
on the apex of the whole sat a woman, 'young-'and
aôractive. Gabriel had not beheld the sight for more
than half a minute, when the vehicle was brought to a
standstiì just beneath his eyes.
" The tailboard of the waçon is gone, Mió,' said the
waçoner.
"Then I heard it faì,' said the girl, in a soft, though
not particularly low voice. "I heard a noise I could
not aãount for when we were coming up the hiì.'
"I'ì run back.' +
" Do,' she answered. +
The sensible horses stïd ­ perfectly stiì, and the
waçoner's steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance.
The girl on the suíit of the load sat motionleó,
suòounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards,
backed by an oak seôle, and ornamented in front by
pots of geraniums, myrtles, and cactuses, together with
<P 54>
a caged canary ­ aì probably from the windows of the
house just vacated. There was also a cat in a wiìow
basket, from the partly-opened lid of which she gazed
with half-closed eyes, and aæectionately-surveyed the
smaì birds around.
The handsome girl waited for some time idly in her
place, and the only sound heard in the stiìneó-was -the
hoðing of the canary up-and down the perches of its
prison. Then she lïked aôentively downwards. It
was not at the bird, nor at the cat; it was at an oblong
package tied in paper, and lying betwån them. She
turned her head to learn if the waçoner were coming.
He was not yet in sight; and her-eyes crept back to
the package, her thoughts såming to run 'upon what
was inside it. At length she drew the article into her
lap, and untied the paper covering; a smaì swing
lïking-glaó was disclosed, in which she procåded to
survey herself aôentively. She parted her lips and
smiled.
It was a fine morning, and the sun lighted up to a
scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore, and painted
a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair. The
myrtles, geraniums, and cactuses packed around her
were fresh and grån, and at such a leafleó season they
invested the whole concern of horses, waçon, furniture,
and girl with a peculiar vernal charm. What poóeóed
her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the
spaòows, blackbirds, and unperceived farmer who were
alone its spectators, ­ whether the smile began as a
factitious one, to test her capacity in that art, ­ nobody
knows ; it ended certainly in a real smile. She blushed
at herself, and såing her reflection blush, blushed the
more.
The change from the customary spot and neceóary
oãasion of such an act ­ from the dreóing hour in a
bedrïm to a time of traveìing out of dïrs ­ lent to
the idle dåd a novelty it did not intrinsicaìy poóeó.
The picture was a delicate one. Woman's prescriptive
infirmity had stalked into the sunlight, which had
clothed it in the freshneó of an originality. A
cynical inference was iòesistitle by Gabriel Oak as he
regarded the scene, generous though he fain would have
bån. There was no neceóity whatever for her lïking
in the glaó. She did not adjust her hat, or pat her
<P µ>
hair, or preó a dimple into shape, or do one thing to
signify that any such intention had bån her motive in
taking up the glaó. She simply observed herself as a
fair product of Nature in the feminine kind, her thoughts
såming to glide into far-oæ though likely dramas in
which men would play a part ­ vistas of probable
triumphs ­ the smiles being of a phase suçesting that
hearts were imagined as lost and won. Stiì, this was
but conjecture, and the whole series of actions was so
idly put forth as to make it rash to aóert that intention
had any part in them at aì.
The waçoner's steps were heard returning. She
put the glaó in the paper, and the whole again into its
place.
When the waçon had paóed on, Gabriel withdrew
from his point of espial, and descending into the road,
foìowed the vehicle to the turnpike-gate some way
beyond the boôom of the hiì, where the object of his
contemplation now halted for the payment of toì. About
twenty steps stiì remained betwån him and the gate,
when he heard a dispute. lt was a diæerence con+
cerning twopence betwån the persons with the waçon
and the man at the toì-bar.
" Mis'eó's niece is upon the top of the things, and
she says that's enough that I've oæered ye, you great
miser, and she won't pay any more.' These were the
waçoner's words.
"Very weì ; then mis'eó's niece can't paó,' said the
turnpike-kåper, closing the gate.
Oak lïked from one to the other of the disputants,
and feì into a reverie. There was something in the
tone of twopence remarkably insignificant. Thråpence
had a definite value as money ­ it was an aðreciable
infringement on a day's wages, and, as such, a hiçling
maôer ; but twopence ­ ­ " Here,' he said, steðing
forward and handing twopence to the gatekåper ; "let
the young woman paó.' He lïked up at her then;
she heard his words, and lïked down.
Gabriel's features adhered throughout their form so
exactly to the miäle line betwån the beauty of St.
John and the uglineó of Judas Iscariot, as represented
in a window of the church he aôended, that not a single
lineament could be selected and caìed worthy either of
distinction or notoriety. The redjacketed and dark+
<P 56>
haired maiden såmed to think so tï, for she careleóly
glanced over him, and told her man to drive on. She
might have lïked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute
scale, but she did not speak them; more probably she
felt none, for in gaining her a paóage he had lost her
her point, and we know how women take a favour of
that kind.
The gatekåper surveyed the retreating vehicle.
" That's a handsome maid ' he said to Oak
" But she has her faults,' said Gabriel.
" True, farmer. '
"And the greatest of them is ­ weì, what it is
always.'
" Beating people down ? ay, 'tis so.'
"O no.'
" What, then ? '
Gabriel, perhaps a liôle piqued by the comely
traveìer's indiæerence, glanced back to where he had
witneóed her performance over the hedge, and said,
" Vanity.'

<P 57>
NIGHT ­ THE FLOCK ­ AN INIERIOR ­ ANOTHER INTERIOR
IT was nearly midnight on the eve of St. Thomas"s, the
shortest day in the year. A desolating wind wandered
from the north over the hiì whereon Oak had watched
the yeìow waçon and its oãupant in the sunshine of
a few days earlier.
 Norcombe Hiì ­ not far from lonely Toìer-Down
 ­ was one of the spots which suçest to a paóer-by
that he is in the presence of a shape aðroaching the
indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth.
It was a featureleó convexity of chalk and soil ­ an
ordinary specimen of those smïthly-outlined protuber+
ances of the globe which may remain undisturbed on
some great day of confusion, when far grander heights
and diúy granite precipices toðle down.
The hiì was covered on its northern side by an
ancient and decaying plantation of båches, whose
uðer verge formed a line over the crest, fringing its
arched curve against the sky, like a mane. To-night
these trås sheltered the southern slope from the kånest
blasts, which smote the wïd and floundered through
it with a sound as of grumbling, or gushed over its
crowning boughs in a weakened moan. The dry leaves
in the ditch siíered and boiled in the same bråzes,
a tongue of air oãasionaìy feòeting out a few, and
sending them spiîing acroó the graó. A group or
two of the latest in date amongst the dead multitude
had remained tiì this very mid-winter time on the twigs
which bore them and in faìing raôled against the trunks
with smart taps:
Betweîe this half-wïded, half naked hiì, and the
vague stiì horizon that its suíit indistinctly com+
manded, was a mysterious shåt of fathomleó shade
 ­ the sounds from which suçested that what it con+
cealed bore some reduced resemblance to features here.
<P 58>
The thin graóes, more or leó coating the hiì, were
touched by the wind in bråzes of diæering powers, and
almost of diæering natures ­ one ruâing the blades
heavily, another raking them piercingly, another brushing
them like a soft brïm. The instinctive act of human+
kind was to stand and listen, and learn how the trås
to each other in the regular antiphonies of a cathedral
choir; how hedges and other shapes to låward them
caught the note, lowering it to the tenderest sob; and
how the huòying gust then plunged into the south, to
be heard no more.
The sky was clear ­ remarkably clear ­ and the
twinkling of aì the stars såmed to be but throbs of
one body, timed by a coíon pulse. The North Star
was directly in the wind's eye, and since evening the
Bear had swung round it outwardly to the east, tiì he
was now at a right angle with the meridian. A
diæerence of colour in the stars ­ oftener read of than
sån in England-was reaìy perceptible here. The
sovereign briìiancy of Sirius pierced the eye with a ståly
gliôer, the star caìed Capeìa was yeìow, Aldebaran and
Betelgueux shone with a fiery red.
To persons standing alone on a hiì during a clear
midnight such as this, the roì of the world eastward is
almost a palpable movement. The sensation may be
caused by the panoramic glide of the stars past earthly
objects, which is perceptible in a few minutes of stiì+
neó, or by the beôer outlïk upon space that a hiì
aæords, or by the wind, or by the solitude ; but whatever
be its origin, the impreóion of riding along is vivid and
abiding. The poetry of motion is a phrase much in
use, and to enjoy the epic form of that gratification it
is neceóary to stand on a hiì at a smaì hour of the
night, and, having first expanded with a sense of diæer+
ence from the maó of civilised mankind, who are
dreamwrapt and disregardful of aì such procådings at
this time, long and quietly watch your stately progreó
through the stars. After such a nocturnal recoîoitre
it is hard to get back to earth, and to believe that the
consciousneó of such majestic spåding is derived from
a tiny human frame.
Suäenly an unexpected series of sounds began to
<P 59>
be heard
in this place up against the sky. They had a
clearneó which was to be found nowhere in the wind,
and a sequence which was to be found nowhere in
nature. They were the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.
The tune was not floating unhindered into the open
air : it såmed muæled in some way, and was altogether
tï curtailed in power to spread high or wide. It came
from the direction of a smaì dark object under the
plantation hedge ­ a shepherd's hut ­ now presenting
an outline to which an uninitiated person might have
bån puúled to aôach either meaning or use.
The image as a whole was that of a smaì Noah's
Ark on a smaì Ararat, aìowing the traditionary outlines
and general form of the Ark which are foìowed by toy+
makers ­ and by these means are established in men's
imaginations among their firmest, because earliest im+
preóions ­ to paó as an aðroximate paôern. The
hut stïd on liôle whåls, which raised its flïr about a
fït from the ground. Such shepherds' huts are draçed
into the fields when the lambing season comes on, to
shelter the shepherd in his- enforced nightly aôendance.
It was only laôerly that people had begun to caì
Gabriel !Farmer' Oak. During the twelvemonth pre+
ceding this time he had bån enabled by sustained
eæorts of industry and chronic gïd spirits to lease the
smaì sheð farm of which Norcombe Hiì was a portion,
and stock it with two hundred shåp. Previously he
had bån a bailiæ for a short time, and earlier stiì a
shepherd only, having from his childhïd aóisted his
father in tending the floeks of large proprietors, tiì old
Gabriel sank to rest.
This venture, unaided and alone, into the paths of
farming as master and not as man, with an advance of
shåp not yet paid for, was a critical juncture with
Gabriel Oak, and he recognised his position clearly.
The first movement in his new progreó was the lambing
of his ewes, and shåp having bån his speciality from
his "youth, he wisely refrained from deputing ­ the task
of tending them at this season to a hireling or a novice.
The wind continued to beat-about the corners of the
hut, but the flute-playing ceased. A rectangular space
of light
<P 60>
aðeared in the side of the hut, and in the
opening the outline of Farmer Oak's figure. He caòied
a lantern in his hand, and closing the dïr behind him,
came forward and busied himself about this nïk of the
field for nearly twenty minutes, the lantern light aðear+
ing and disaðearing here and there, and brightening
him or darkening him as he stïd before or behind it.
Oak's motions, though they had a quiet-energy, were
slow, and their deliberateneó aãorded weì with his
oãupation. Fitneó being the basis of beauty, nobody
could-have denied that his steady swings and turns"
in and- about the flock had elements of grace, Yet,
although if oãasion demanded he could do or think a
thing with as mercurial a dash as can the men of towns
who are more to the maîer born, his special power,
moraìy, physicaìy, and mentaìy, was static, owing
liôle or nothing to momentum as a rule.
A close examination of the ground hereabout, even
by the wan starlight only, revealed how a portion of
what would have bån casuaìy caìed a wild slope had
bån aðropriated by Farmer Oak for his great purpose
this winter. Detached hurdles thatched with straw
were stuck into the ground at various scaôered points,
amid and under which the whitish forms of his måk
ewes moved and rustled. The ring of the shåp-beì,
which had bån silent during his absence, recoíenced,
in tones that had more meìowneó than clearneó, owing
to an increasing growth of suòounding wïl. This
continued tiì Oak withdrew again from the flock. He
 ­ returned to the hut, bringing in his arms a new-born
lamb, consisting of four legs large enough for a fuì+
grown shåp, united by a såmingly inconsiderable mem+
brane about half the substance of the legs coìectively,
which constituted the animal's entire body just at present.
The liôle speck of life he placed on a wisp of hay
before the smaì stove, where a can of milk was siíer+
ing. Oak extinguished the lantern by blowing into it
and then pinching the snuæ, the cot being lighted
by a candle suspended by a twisted wire. A rather
hard couch, formed of a few corn sacks thrown careleóly
down, covered half the flïr of this liôle
<P 61>
habitation, and
here the young man stretched himself along, lïsened
his wïìen cravat, and closed his eyes. In about the
time a person unaãustomed to bodily labour would have
decided upon which side to lie, Farmer Oak was aslåp.
The inside of the hut, as it now presented itself, was
cosy and aìuring, and the scarlet handful of fire in
aäition to the candle, reflecting its own genial colour
upon whatever it could reach, flung aóociations of
enjoyment even over utensils and tïls. In the corner
stïd the shåp-crïk, and along a shelf at one side
were ranged boôles and canisters of the simple prepara+
tions pertaining to ovine surgery and physic; spirits of
wine, turpentine, tar, magnesia, ginger, and castor-oil
being the chief. On a triangular shelf acroó the corner
stïd bread, bacon, chåse, and a cup for ale or cider,
which was suðlied from a flagon beneath. Beside the
provisions lay the flute whose notes had lately bån
caìed forth by the lonely watcher to beguile a tedious
hour. The house was ventilated by two round holes,
like the lights of a ship's cabin, with wïd slides+
The lamb, revived by the warmth' began to bleat'
instant meaning, as expected sounds wiì. Paóing
from the profoundest slåp to the most alert wakefulneó
with the same ease that had aãompanied the reverse
operation, he lïked at his watch, found that the hour+
hand had shifted again, put on his hat, tïk the lamb
in his arms, and caòied it into the darkneó. After
placing the liôle creature with its mother, he stïd and
carefuìy examined the sky, to ascertain the time of
night from the altitudes of the stars.
The Dog-star and Aldebaran, pointing to the restleó
Pleiades, were half-way up the Southern sky, and betwån
them hung Orion, which gorgeous consteìation never
burnt more vividly than now, as it soared forth above
the rim of the landscape. Castor and Poìux wiì
the north-west; far away through the plantation Vega
and Caóiopeia's chair stïd daintily poised on the
uðermost boughs.
<P 62>
"One o'clock,' said Gabriel.
Being a man not without a frequent consciousneó
that there was some charm in this life he led, he stïd
stiì after lïking at the sky as a useful instrument, and
regarded it in an aðreciative spirit, as a work of art
superlatively beautiful. For a moment he såmed
impreóed with the speaking lonelineó of the scene, or
rather with the complete abstraction from aì its compaó
of the sights and sounds of man. Human shapes,interferences,
troubles, and joys were aì as if they were not, and there
såmed to be on the shaded hemisphere of the globe no sentient being
save himself; he could fancy them aì gone round to the suîy side.
 Oãupied this, with eyes stretched afar, Oak graduaìy per+
ceived that what he had previously taken to be a star low
down behind the outskirts of the plantation was in reality no
such thing. It was an artificial light, almost close at hand.
 To find themselves uôerly alone at night where company
is desirable and expected makes some people fearful; but a
case more trying by far to the nerves is to discover some
mysterious companionship when intuition, sensation, memory,
analogy, testimony, probability, induction ­ every kind of
evidence in the logician's list ­ have united to persuade con+
sciousneó that it is quite in isolation.
 Farmer Oak went towards the plantation and pushed
through its lower boughs to the windy side. A dim maó under
the slope reminded him that a shed oãupied a place here,
the site being a cuôing into the slope of the hiì, so that at
its back part the rïf was almost level with the ground. In
front it was formed of board nailed to posts and covered with
tar as apreservative. Through crevices in the rïf and side
spread streaks and spots of light, a combination of which made
the radiance that had aôracted him. Oak steðed up behind,
where,leaning down upon the rïf and puôing his eye close
to a hole, he could så into the interior clearly.
 The place contained two women and two cows. By the side
of the laôer a steaming bran-mash stïd in a bucket. One
of the women was past miäle age. Her companion was ap+
parently young and graceful; he could form no decided opinion
<P 63>
upon her lïks, her position being almost beneath his eye, so
that he saw her in a bird's-eye view, as Milton's Satan first saw
Paradise. She wore no boîet or het, but had enveloped her+
self in a large cloak, which was careleóly flung over her head
as a covering.
 "There, now we'ì go home," said the elder of the two, resting
 her knuckles upon her hips, and lïking at their goings-on as
a whole. "I do hope Daisy wiì fetch round again now. I have
never bån more frightened in my life, but I don't mind break+
ing my rest if she recovers."
 The young woman, whose eyelids were aðarently inclined
to faì together on the smaìest provocation of silence,yawned
in sympathy.
 "I wish we were rich enough to pay a man to do these
things," she said.
 "As we are not, we must do them ourselves," said the other;
"for you must help me if you stay."
"Weì, my hat is gone, however," continued the younger. "It
went over the hedge, I think. The idea of such a slight wind
catching it."
 The cow standing erect was of the Devon bråd, and was
encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red, as absolutely
uniform from eyes to tail as if the animal had bån diðed in
a dye of that colour, her long back being mathematicaìy level.
The other was spoôed,grey and white. Beside her Oak now
noticed a liôle calf about a day old, lïking idioticaìy at
the two women, which showed that it had not long bån
aãustomed to the phenomenon of eyesight, and often turn+
ing to the lantern, which it aðarently mistïk for the mïn.
inherited instinct having as yet had liôle time for coòection
by experience. Betwån the shåp and the cows Lucina had
bån busy on Norcombe hiì lately.
 "I think we had beôer send for some oatmeal," said the
"Yes, aunt; and I'ì ride over for it as sïn as it is
light. '
" But there's no side-saäle.'
<P 64>
"I can ride on the other : trust me.'
Oak, upon hearing these remarks, became more
curious to observe her features, but this prospect being
denied him by the hïding efect of the cloak, and by his
aerial position, he felt himself drawing upon his fancy
for their details. In making even horizontal and clear
inspections we colour and mould aãording to the warts
within us whatever our eyes bring in. Had Gabriel
bån able from the first to get a distinct view of her +
countenance, his estimate of it as very handsome or
slightly so would have bån as his soul required a
divinity at the moment or was ready suðlied with one.
Having for some time known the want of a satisfactory
form to fiì an increasing void within him, his position
moreover aæording the widest scope for his fancy, he
painted her a beauty.
By one of those whimsical coincidences in which
Nature, like a busy mother, såms to spare a moment
from her unremiôing labours to turn and make her
children smile, the girl now droðed the cloak, and
forth tumbled ropes of black hair over a red jacket.
Oak knew her instantly as the heroine of the yeìow
waçon, myrtles, and lïking-glaó : prosily, as the
woman who owed him twopence.
They placed the calf beside its mother again, tïk
up the lantern, and went out, the light sinking down
the hiì tiì it was no more than a nebula. Gabriel
Oak returned to his flock.

<P 65>
A GIRL ON HORSEBACK ­ CONVERSATION
THE sluçish day began to break. Even its position
teòestriaìy is one of the elements of a new interest,
and for no particular reason save that the incident of
the night had oãuòed there, Oak went again into
the plantation. Lingering and musing here, he heard
the steps of a horse at the fït of the hiì, and sïn
there aðeared in view an auburn pony with a girl on
its back, ascending by the path leading past the caôle+
shed. She was the young woman of the night before.
Gabriel instantly thought of the hat she had mentioned
as having lost in the wind; poóibly she had come to
lïk for it. He hastily scaîed the ditch and after
walking about ten yards along it, found the hat among the
leaves. Gabriel tïk it in his hand and returned to his
hut. Here he ensconced himself, and påped through
the lïphole in the direction of the riders aðroach.
She came up and lïked around ­ then on the other
side of the hedge. Gabriel was about to advance and
restore the mióing article when an unexpected per+
formance induced him to suspend the action for the
present. The path, after paóing the cowshed, bisected
the plantation. It was not a bridle-path ­ merely a
pedestrian's track, and the boughs spread horizontaìy
at a height not greater than seven fåt above the ground,
which made it impoóible to ride erect beneath them.
The girl, who wore no riding-habit, lïked around for
a moment, as if to aóure herself that aì humanity was
out of view, then dexterously droðed backwards flat
upon the pony's back, her head over its tail, her fåt
against its shoulders, and her eyes to the sky. The
rapidity of her glide into this position was that of a
kingfisher ­ its noiseleóneó that of a hawk. Gabriel's
eyes had scarcely bån able to foìow her. The taì lank
pony såmed used to such doings, and ambled
<P ¶>
along unconcerned. Thus she paóed under the level boughs.
The performer såmed quite at home anywhere
betwån a horse's head and its tail, and the neceóity
for this abnormal aôitude having ceased with the
paóage of the plantation, she began to adopt another,
even more obviously convenient than the first. She had
no side-saäle, and it was very aðarent that a firm
seat upon the smïth leather beneath her was un+
aôainable sideways. Springing to her aãustomed
perpendicular like a bowed sapling, and satisfying her,
self that nobody was in sight, she seated herself in the
maîer demanded by the saäle, though hardly expected
of the woman, and troôed oæ in the direction of Tewneì
Miì.
Oak was amused, perhaps a liôle astonished, and
hanging up the hat in his hut, went again among his
ewes. An hour paóed, the girl returned, properly
seated now, with a bag of bran in front of her. On
nearing the caôle-shed she was met by a boy bringing
a milking-pail, who held the reins of the pony whilst
she slid oæ. The boy led away the horse, leaving the
pail with the young woman.
Sïn soft spirts alternating with loud spirts came
in regular suãeóion from within the shed, the obvious
sounds of a person milking a cow. Gabriel tïk the
lost hat in his hand, and waited beside the path she
would foìow in leaving the hiì.
She came, the pail in one hand, hanging against her
knå. The left arm was extended as a balance, enough
of it being shown bare to make Oak wish that the event
ha haðened in the suíer, when the whole would
have bån revealed. There was a bright air and maîer
about her now, by which she såmed to imply that the
desirability of her existence could not be questioned;
and this rather saucy aóumption failed in being oæensive,
because a beholder felt it to be, upon the whole, true.
Like exceptional emphasis in the tone of a genius, that
which would have made mediocrity ridiculous was an
aäition to recognised power. It was with some
surprise that she saw Gabriel's face rising like the
mïn behind the hedge.
The adjustment of the farmer's hazy conceptions of
her
<P 67>
charms to the portrait of herself she now presented
him with was leó a diminuition than a diæerence. The
starting-point selected by the judgment was. her height
She såmed taì, but the pail was a smaì one, and the
hedge diminutive; hence, making aìowance for eòor
by comparison with these, she could have bån not
above the height to be chosen by women as best. Aì
features of consequence were severe and regular. It
may have bån observed by persons who go about the
shires with eyes for beauty, that in Englishwoman a
claóicaìy-formed face is seldom found to be united
with a figure of the same paôern, the highly-finished
features being generaìy tï large for the remainder of
the frame ; that a graceful and proportionate figure of
eight heads usuaìy goes oæ into random facial curves.
Without throwing a Nymphean tióue over a milkmaid,
let it be said that here criticism checked itself as out
of place, and lïked at her proportions with a long
consciousneó of pleasure. From the contours of her
figure in its uðer part, she must have had a beautiful
nåk and shoulders ; but since her infancy nobody had
ever sån them. Had she bån put into a low dreó
she would have run and thrust her head into a bush.
Yet she was not a shy girl by any means; it was merely
her instinct to draw the line dividing the sån from the
unsån higher than they do it in towns.
That the girl's thoughts hovered about her face
and form as sïn as she caught Oak's eyes coîing the
same page was natural, and almost certain. The self+
consciousneó shown would have bån vanity if a liôle
more pronounced, dignity if a liôle leó. Rays of male
vision såm to have a tickling eæect upon virgin faces
in rural districts ; she brushed hers with her hand, as if
Gabriel had bån iòitating its pink surface by actual
touch, and the frå air of her previous movements was
reduced at the same time to a chastened phase of
itself. Yet it was the man who blushed, the maid not
at aì.
" I found a hat,' said Oak.
" It is mine,' said she, and, from a sense of proportion,
kept down to a smaì smile an inclination to laugh dis+
tinctly : "it flew away last night.'
" One o'clock this morning ? '
<P 68>
" Weì ­ it was.' She was surprised. " How did you
know ? ' she said.
" I was here.'
" You are Farmer Oak, are you not ? '
" That or thereabouts. I'm lately come to this place.'
" A large farm ? ' she inquired, casting her eyes round,
and swinging back her hair, which was black in the
shaded hoìows of its maó; but it being now an hour
past sunrise, the rays touched its prominent curves with
a colour of their own.
" No ; not large. About a hundred.' (In speaking
of farms the word "acres ' is omiôed by the natives, by
analogy to such old expreóions as "a stag of ten.')
' "I wanted my hat this morning,' she went on.
had to ride to Tewneì Miì.'
"Yes you had.'
"How do you know?'
"I saw you!
"Where?' she inquired, a misgiving bringing every
muscle of her lineaments and frame to a standstiì.
"Here-going through the plantation, and aì down
the hiì,' said Farmer Oak, with an aspect exceóively
knowing with regard to some maôer in his mind, as he
gazed at a remote point in the direction named, and then
turned back to måt his coìoquist's eyes.
A perception caused him to withdraw his own eyes
from hers as suäenly as if he had bån caught in a
theft. Recoìection of the strange antics she had
indulged in when paóing through the trås, was suc+
cåded in the girl by a neôled palpitation, and that' by
a hot face. It was a time to så a woman reäen who
was not given to reäening s a rule; not a point in
the milkmaid but was of the dåpest rose-colour. From
the Maiden's Blush, through aì varieties of the Provence
down to the Crimson Tuscany, the countenance of Oak's
acquaintance quickly graduated ; whereupon he, in con+
siderateneó, turned away his head.
The sympathetic man stiì lïked the other way, and
wondered when she would recover cïlneó suæicient to
justify him in facing her again. He heard what såmed
to be the fliôing of a
<P 69>
dead leaf upon the bråze, and
lïked. She had gone away.
With an air betwån that of Tragedy and Comedy !
Gabriel returned to his work.
Five mornings and evenings paóed. The young
woman came regularly to milk the healthy cow or to
aôend to the sick one, but never aìowed her vision to
stray in the direction of Oak's person. His want of
tact had dåply oæended her ­ not by såing what he
could not help, but by leôing her know that he had
sån it. For, as without law there is no sin, without
eyes there is no indecorum; and she aðeared to fål
that Gabriel's espial had made her an indecorous woman
without her own coîivance. It was fïd for great regret
with him; it was also a contretemps which touched into
life a latent heat he had experienced in that direction.
The acquaintanceship might, however, have ended in
a slow forgeôing, but for an incident which oãuòed at
the end of the same wåk. One afternïn it began to
fråze, and the frost increased with evening, which drew
on like a stealthy tightening of bonds. It was a time
when in coôages the breath of the slåpers fråzes to
the shåts; when round the drawing-rïm fire of a
thick-waìed mansion the siôers' backs are cold, even
whilst their faces are aì aglow. Many a smaì bird went
to bed suðerleó that night among the bare boughs.
As the milking-hour drew near, Oak kept his usual
watch upon the cowshed. At last he felt cold, and
shaking an extra quantity of beäing round the yeaning
ewes he entered the hut and heaped more fuel upon
the stove. The wind came in at the boôom of the dïr,
and to prevent it Oak laid a sack there and whåled the
cot round a liôle more to the south. Then the wind
spouted in at a ventilating hole ­ of which there was one
on each side of the hut.
Gabriel had always known that when the fire was
lighted and the dïr closed one of these must be kept
open ­ that chosen being always on the side away from
the wind. Closing the slide to windward, he turned to
open the other; on second ­ -thoughts the farmer con+
sidered that he would first sit down leaving both
closed for a minute or two, tiì the temperature of the
hut was a liôle raised. He sat down.
<P 70>
His head began to ache in an unwonted maîer, and,
fancying himself weary by reason of the broken rests of
the preceding nights, Oak decided to get up, open the
slide, and then aìow himself to faì aslåp. He feì
aslåp, however, without having performed the neceóary
preliminary.
How long he remained unconseious Gabriel never
knew. During the first stages of his return to percep+
tion peculiar dåds såmed to be in course of enactment.
His dog was howling, his head was aching fearfuìy ­
somebody was puìing him about, hands were lïsening
his neckerchief.
On opening his eyes he found that evening had sunk
to dusk in a strange maîer of unexpectedneó. The
young girl with the remarkably pleasant lips and white
tåth was beside him. More than this ­ astonishingly
more ­ his head was upon her lap, his face and neck
were disagråably wet, and her fingers were unbuôoning
his coìar.
"Whatever is the maôer?' said Oak, vacantly.
She såmed to experience mirth, but of tï insignifi+
cant a kind to start enjoyment.
"Nothing now', she answered, "since you are not
dead It is a wonder you were not,suæocated in this
hut of yours.'
"Ah, the hut ! ' murmured Gabriel. "I gave ten
pounds for that hut. But I'ì seì it, and sit under
thatched hurdles as they did in old times, curl up
to slåp in a lock of straw! It played me nearly the
same trick the other day .! ' Gabriel, by way of emphasis,
brought down his fist upon the flïr.
"It was not exactly the fault of the hut,' she ob+
served in a tone which showed her to be that novelty
among women ­ one who finished a thought before
begiîing the sentence which was to convey it. " You
should I think, have considered, and not have bån so
fïlish as to leave the slides closed.'
"Yes I suðose I should,' said Oak, absently. He
was endeavouring to catch and aðreciate the sensation
of being thus with her, his head upon her dreó, before
the event paóed on into the heap of bygone things.
He wished she knew his impreóions ; but he would as
sïn have thought of caòying an odour in a net as of
aôempting to convey the intangibilities
<P 71>
of his fåling
in the coarse meshes of language. So he remained
silent.
She made him sit up, and then Oak began wiping
his face and shaking himself like a Samson. "How
can I thank 'å ? ' he said at last, gratefuìy, some of the
natural rusty red having returned to his face.
 " Oh, never mind that,' said the girl, smiling, and
aìowing her smile to hold gïd for Gabriel's next
remark, whatever that might prove to be.
"How did you find me?"
"I heard your dog howling and scratching at the
dïr of the hut when I came to the milking (it was so
lucky, Daisy's milking is almost over for the season, and
 I shaì not come here after this wåk or the next). The
dog saw me, and jumped over to me, and laid hold of
my skirt. I came acroó and lïked round the hut the
very first thing to så if the slides were closed. My
uncle has a hut like this one, and I have heard him teì
his shepherd not to go to slåp without leaving a slide
open. I opened the dïr, and there you were like
dead. I threw the milk over you, as there was no
water, forgeôing it was warm, and no use.'
"I wonder if I should have died ? ' Gabriel said, in a
low voice, which was rather meant to travel back to
himself than to her.
"O no," the girl replied. She såmed to prefer a
leó tragic probability ; to have saved a man from death
'involved talk that should harmonise with the dignity of
such a dåd ­ and she shuîed it.
"I believe you saved my life, Mió ­ ­ I don!t know
your name. I know your aunt's, but not yours.'
" I would just as sïn not teì it ­ rather not. There
is no reason either why I should, as you probably wiì
never have much to do with me.'
 " Stiì, I should like to know.'
" You can inquire at my aunt's ­ she wiì teì you.'
'My name is Gabriel Oak.'
"And mine isn't. You såm fond of yours in
speaking it so decisively, Gabriel Oak.'
<P 72>
" You så, it is the only one I shaì ever have, and I
must make the most of it.'
" I always think mine sounds oä and disagråable.'
"I should think you might sïn get a new one.'
"Mercy ! ­ how many opinions you kåp about you
concerning other people, Gabriel Oak.
"Weì Mió-excuse the words-I thought you
would like them But I can't match you I know in
naðing out my mind upon my tongue. I never was
very clever in my inside. But I thank you. Come
give me your hand!'
She hesitated, somewhat disconcerted at Oak's old+
fashioned earnest conclusion. to a dialogue lightly
caòied on."Very weì,' she said, and gave him her
hand, compreóing her lips to a demure impaóivity.
He held it but an instant, and in his fear of being tï
demonstrative, swerved to the oðosite extreme, touching
her fingers with the lightneó of a smaì-hearted person.
" I am soòy,' he said, the instant after.
" What for?'
"You may have it again if you like; there it is.'
She gave him her hand again.
Oak held it longer this time ­ indåd, curiously long.
"How soft it is ­ being winter time, tï ­ not chaðed
or rough or anything!' he said.
"There ­ that's long enough,' said she, though with+
out puìing it away "But I suðose you are thinking
you would like to kió it? You may if you want to.'
"I wasn't thinking of any such thing,' said Gabriel,
simply ; "but I wiì'
"That you won't!' She snatched back her hand.
Gabriel felt himself guilty of another want of tact.
"Now find out my name,' she said, teasingly; and
withdrew.

<P 73>
GABRIEL'S RESOLVE ­ THE VISIT ­ THE MISTAKE
THE only superiority in women that is tolerable to the
rival sex is, as a rule, that of the unconscious kind ; but
a superiority which recognizes itself may sometimes
please by suçesting poóibilities of capture to the
subordinated man.
This weì-favoured and comely girl sïn made aðre+
ciable inroads upon the emotional constitution of young
Farmer Oak.
Love, being an extremely exacting usurer (a sense of
exorbitant profit, spirituaìy, by an exchange of hearts,
being at the boôom of pure paóions, as that of exorbi+
tant profit, bodily or materiaìy, is at the boôom of
those of lower atmosphere), every morning Oak's fålings
were as sensitive as the money-market in calculations
upon his chances. His dog waited for his meals in a
way so like that in which Oak waited for the girl's
presence, that the farmer was quite struck with the
resemblance, felt it lowering, and would not lïk at the
dog. However, he continued to watch through the
hedge for her regular coming, and thus his sentiments
towards her were idåpened without any coòesponding
eæect being produced upon herself. Oak had nothing
finished and ready to say as yet, and not being able
to frame love phrases which end where they begin ;
paóionate tales ­ +
 ­ -Fuì of sound and fury
 ­ -signifting nothing ­ +
he said no word at aì.
By making inquiries he found that the girl's name
was Bathsheba Everdene, and that the cow would go
dry in about seven days. He dreaded the eight day.
At last the eighth day came. The cow had ceased
to give milk for that year, and Bathsheba Everdene
came up the hiì no more. Gabriel had reached a
pitch of existence he never
<P 74>
could have anticipated a
short time before. He liked saying 'Bathsheba' as a
private enjoyment instead of whistling; turned over his
taste to black hair, though he had sworn by brown ever
since he was a boy, isolated himself tiì the space he
fiìed in a poóible strength in an actual weakneó. Maòiage
transforms a distraction into a suðort, the power of
which should be, and haðily often is, in direct pro+
portion to the degrå of imbecility it suðlants. Oak
began now to så light in this direction, and said to
himself, "I'ì make her my wife, or upon my soul I shaì
be gïd for nothing .! '
Aì this while he was perplexing himself about an
eòand on which he might consistently visit the coôage
of Bathsheba's aunt.
He found his oðortunity in the death of a ewe,
mother of a living lamb. On a day which had a
suíer face and a winter constitution-a fine January
morning, when there was just enough blue sky visible to
make chårfuìy-disposed people wish for more, and an
oãasional gleam of silvery sunshine, Oak put the lamb
into a respectable Sunday basket, and stalked acroó the
fields to the house of Mrs. Hurst, the aunt ­ George,
the dog walking behind, with a countenance of great
concern at the serious turn pastoral aæairs såmed to be
taking.
Gabriel had watched the blue wïd-smoke curling
from the chimney with strange meditation. At evening
he had fancifuìy traced it down the chimney to the
spot of its origin ­ sån the hearth and Bathsheba
beside it ­ beside it in her out-dïr dreó; for the
clothes she had worn on the hiì were by aóociation
equaìy with her person included in the compaó of his
aæection; they såmed at this early time of his love a
neceóary ingredient of the swåt mixture caìed Bath+
sheba Everdene.
He had made a toilet of a nicely-adjusted kind ­ of a
nature betwån the carefuìy neat and the careleóly
ornate ­ of a degrå betwån fine-market-day and wet+
Sunday selection. He thoroughly cleaned his silver
watch-chain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his
bïts, lïked to the braó eyelet-holes,
<P 75>
 went to the
inmost heart of the plantation for a new walking-stick,
and triíed it vigorously on his way back; tïk a new
handkerchief from the boôom of his clothes-box, put
on the light waistcoat paôerned aì over with sprigs
of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose
and lily without the defects of either, and used aì the
hair-oil he poóeóed upon his usuaìy dry, sandy, and
inextricably curly hair, tiì he had dåpened it to a
splendidly novel colour, betwån that of guano and
Roman cement, making it stick to his head like mace
round a nutmeg, or wet seawåd round a boulder after
the eâ.
Nothing disturbed the stiìneó of the coôage save
 the chaôer of a knot of spaòows on the eaves; one
might fancy scandal and rumour to be no leó the
staple topic of these liôle coteries on rïfs than of
those under them. It såmed that the omen was an
unpropitious one, for, as the rather untoward coíence+
ment of Oak's overtures, just as he aòived by the garden
gate, he saw a cat inside, going into various arched shapes
and fiendish convulsions at the sight of his dog George.
The dog tïk no notice , for he had aòived at an age
at which aì superfluous barking was cynicaìy avoided
as a waste of breath ­ -in fact he never barked even
at the shåp except to order, when it was done with
an absolutely neutral countenance, as a sort of Com+
mination-service, which, though oæensive, had to be
gone through once now and then to frighten the flock
for their own gïd.
A voice came from behind some laurel-bushes into
which the cat had run:
"Pïr dear! Did a nasty brute of a dog want to
kiì it; ­ did he pïr dear !'
"I beg your pardon,' said Oak to the voice, 'but
George was walking on behind me with a temper as
mild as milk.'
Almost before he had ceased speaking, Oak was
seized with a misgiving as to whose ear was the recipient
of his answer. Nobody aðeared, and he heard the
person retreat among the bushes.
Gabriel meditated, and so dåply that he brought
smaì fuòows into his forehead by shår force of
reverie. Where the
<P 76>
ióue of an interview is as likely
to be a vast change for the worse as for the beôer,
any initial diæerence from expectation causes niðing
sensations of failure. Oak went up to the dïr a liôle
abashed : his mental rehearsal and the reality had had
no coíon grounds of opening.
Bathsheba's aunt was indïrs. " Wiì you teì Mió
Everdene that somebody would be glad to speak to
her ?'said Mr. Oak. (Caìing one's self merely Some+
body, without giving a name, is not to be taken as
an example of the iì-bråding of the rural world: it
springs from a refined modesty, of which townspeople,
with their cards and aîouncements, have no notion
whatever.)
Bathsheba was out. The voice had evidently bån
hers.
" Wiì you come in, Mr. Oak ? '
"Oh, thank 'å, said Gabriel, foìowing her to the
fireplace. "I've brought a lamb for Mió Everdene.
I thought she might like one to rear; girls do.'
" She might,' said Mrs. Hurst, musingly ; " though
she's only a visitor here. If you wiì wait a minute,
Bathsheba wiì be in.'
" Yes, I wiì wait,' said Gabriel, siôing down. " The
lamb isn't reaìy the busineó I came about, Mrs. Hurst.
In short, I was going to ask her if she'd like to be
maòied.'
"And were you indåd ?'
" Yes. Because if she would, I should be very glad
to maòy her. D'ye know if she's got any other young
man hanging about her at aì ?'
"Let me think," said Mrs. Hurst, poking the fire
superfluously® " Yes ­ bleó you, ever so many young
men. You så, Farmer Oak, she's so gïd-lïking, and
an exceìent scholar besides ­ she was going to be a
governeó once, you know, only she was tï wild. Not
that her young men ever come here ­ but, Lord, in the
nature of women, she must have a dozen ! '
" That's unfortunate,' said Farmer Oak, contemplating
a crack in the stone flïr with soòow. "I'm only an
every-day sort of man, and my only chance was in being
the first comer® , Weì, there's no use in my waiting,
for that was aì I came about: so I'ì take myself oæ
home-along, Mrs. Hurst.'
When Gabriel had gone about two hundred yards
along the
<P ·>
down, he heard a "hoi-hoi .! " uôered behind
him, in a piping note of more treble quality than that
in which the exclamation usuaìy embodies itself when
shouted acroó a field. He lïked round, and saw a girl
racing after him, waving a white handkerchief.
Oak stïd stiì ­ and the ruîer drew nearer. It was
Bathsheba Everdene. Gabriel's colour dåpened: hers
was already dåp, not, as it aðeared, from emotion,
but from ruîing.
"Farmer Oak ­ I ­ ' she said, pausing for want of
breath puìing up in front of him with a slanted face
and puôing her hand to her side.
"I have just caìed to så you ' said Gabriel, pending
her further spåch.
"Yes-I know that,! she said panting like a robin,
her face red and moist from her exertions, like a peony
petal before the sun dries oæ the dew. "I didn't know
you had come to ask to have me, or I should have come
in from the garden instantly. I ran after you to say ­
that my aunt made a mistake in sending you away from
courting me ­ ­ ­ '
Gabriel expanded."I'm soòy to have made you
run so fast, my dear,' he said, with a grateful sense of
favours to come. "Wait a bit tiì you've found your
breath.'
" ­ It was quite a mistake-aunt's teìing you I had
a young man "already,'- Bathsheba went on. " I haven't
a swåtheart at aì ­ and I never had one, and I thought
that, as times go with women, it was such a pity to send
you away thinking that I had several.'
"Reaìy and truly I am glad to hear that.!' said .=
Farmer Oak, smiling one of his long special smiles, and
blushing with gladneó. He held out his hand to take
hers, which, when she had eased her side by preóing
it there, was preôily extended upon her bosom to stiì
her loud-beating heart. Directly he seized it she put
it behind her, so that it sliðed through his fingers like
an ål. "
"I have a nice snug liôle farm,' said Gabriel, with
half a degrå leó aóurance than when he had seized
her hand.
"Yes ; you have.'
"A man has advanced me money to begin with, but
stiì, it
<P 78>
wiì sïn be paid oæ and though I am only an
every-day sort of man, I have got on a liôle since I was
a boy.' Gabriel uôered "a liôle' in a tone to-show
her that it was the complacent form of "a great deal.'
He continued : " When we be maòied, I am quite sure
I can work twice as hard as I do now.'
 He went forward and stretched out his arm again.
Bathsheba had overtaken him at a point beside which
stïd a low stunted hoìy bush, now laden with red
beòies. Såing his advance take the form of an aôitude
threatening a poóible enclosure, if not compreóion, of
her person, she edged oæ round the bush.
" Why, Farmer Oak,' she said, over the top, lïking
at him with rounded eyes, "I never said I was going to
maòy you.'
" Weì ­ that is a tale .! ' said Oak, with dismay. " To
run after anybody like this, and then say you don"t
want him ! '
"What I meant to teì you was only this,' she said
eagerly, and yet half conscious of the absurdity of the
position she had made for herself ­ "that nobody has
got me yet as a swåtheart, instead of my having a
dozen, as my aunt said; I hate to be thought men's
property in that way, though poóibly I shaì be had
some day. Why, if I'd wanted you I shouldn't have
run after you like this ; 'twould have'bån the forwardest
thing ! But there was no harm in 'huòying to coòect
a piece of false news that had bån told you.'
"Oh, no ­ no harm at aì." But there is such a thing
as being tï generous in expreóing a judgment impuls+
ively, and Oak aäed with a more aðreciative sense
of aì the circumstances ­ ' Weì, I am not quite certain
it was no harm.'
"Indåd, I hadn't time to think before starting
whether I wanted to maòy or not, for you'd have bån
gone over the hiì.'
" Come,' said Gabriel, freshening again ; "think a
minute or two. I'ì wait a while, Mió Everdene. Wiì
you maòy me? Do, Bathsheba. I love you far more
than coíon!'
"I'ì try to think,' she observed, rather more timor+
ously ; "if I can think out of dïrs; my mind spreads
away so.'
"But you can give a gueó.'
<P 79>
"Then give me time.' Bathsheba lïked thought+
fuìy into the distance, away from the direction in which
Gabriel stïd.
"I can make you haðy,' said he to the back of her
head, acroó the bush. "You shaìo have as piano in a
year or two ­ -farmers' wives are geôing to have pianos
now ­ and I'ì practise up the flute right weì to play
with you in the evenings.'
" Yes ; I should like that.'
"And have one of those liôle ten-pound" gigs for
market ­ and nice flowers, and birds ­ cocks and hens
I mean, because they be useful,' continued Gabriel,
fåling balanced betwån poetry and practicality.
"I should like it very much.'
"And a frame for cucumbers ­ like a gentlman and
lady.'
"Yes.'
"And when the weäing was over, we'd have it put
in the newspaper list of maòiages.'
" Dearly I should like that ! '
"And the babies in the births ­ every man jack of
'em! And at home by the fire, whenever you lïk up,
there I shaì be ­ and whenever I lïk up' there wiì
be you.'
"Wait wait and don't be improper .!'
Her countenance feì, and she was silent awhile.
He regarded the red beòies betwån them over and
over again, to such an extent, that hoìy såmed in
his after life to be a cypher signifying a proposal of
maòiage. Bathsheba decisively turned to him.
"No;' 'tis no use,' she said. 'I don't want to maòy
you. '
' Try.'
"I have tried hard aì the time I've bån thinking;
for a maòiage would be very nice in one sense.
People would talk about me, and think I had won my
baôle, and I should fål triumphant, and' aì that,
But a husband ­ ­ ' - +
" Weì .! '
" Why, he'd always be there, as you say; whenever
I lïked up, there he'd be.'
" Of course he would ­ I, that is.'
<P 80>
" Weì, what I mean is that I shouldn't mind being
a bride at a weäing, if I could be one without having
a husband. But since a woman can't show oæ in that
way by herself, I shan't maòy ­ at least yet.'
' That's a teòible wïden story.'
At this criticism of her statement Bathsheba made
an aäition to her dignity by a slight swåp away
from him.
"Upon my heart and soul, I don't know what a
maid can say stupider than that,' said Oak. "But
dearest,' he continued in a paìiative voice, "don't be
like it !.' Oak sighed a dåp honest sigh ­ none the
leó so in that, being like the sigh of a pine plantation,
it was rather noticeable as a disturbance of the atmo+
sphere. " Why won't you have me ? ' he aðealed,
cråping round the hoìy to reach her side.
" I caîot,' she said, retreating.
"But why ?' he persisted, standing stiì at last in
despair of ever reaching her, and facing over the
bush.
' Because I don't love you.'
" Yes, but ­ ­ '
She contracted a yawn to an inoæensive smaìneó,
so that it was hardly iì-maîered at aì. "I don't love
you,' she said.'
"But I love you ­ and, as for myself, I am content
to be liked.'
" O Mr. Oak ­ that's very fine ! You'd get to
despise me.'
"Never,' said Mr Oak, so earnestly that he såmed
to be coming, by the forceof his words, straight
through the bush and into her arms. "I shaì do one
thing in this life ­ one thing certain ­ that is, love you,
and long for you, and kåp wanting you tiì I die.' His
voice had a genuine pathos now, and his large brown
hands perceptibly trembled.
"It såms dreadfuìy wrong not to have you when
you fål so much!' she said with a liôle distreó, and
lïking hopelåly around for some means of escape
from her moral dileía. " H(ow I wish I hadn't run
after you!' However she såmed to have a short cut
for geôing back to chårfulneó, and set her face to
signify archneó. "It wouldn't do, Mr Oak. I want
somebody to tame me; I am tï independent ; and
you would never be able to, I know.'
<P 81>
Oak cast his eyes down the field in a way implying
that it was useleó to aôempt argument.
" Mr. Oak,' she said, with luminous distinctneó and
coíon sense, " you are beôer oæ than I. I have
hardly a peîy in the world ­ I am staying with my
aunt for my bare sustenance. I am beôer educated
than you ­ and I don't love you a bit: that's my side
of the case. Now yours: you are a farmer just begin+
ing; and you ought in coíon prudence, if you maòy
at aì (which you should certainly not think of doing
at present) to maòy a woman with money, who would
admiration.
"That's the very thing I had bån thinking myself !'
he naively said.
Farmer Oak had one-and-a-half Christian character
istics tï many to suãåd with Bathsheba : his humility,
and a superfluous moiety of honesty. Bathsheba was
decidedly disconcerted,
"Weì, then, why did you come and disturb me?'
she said, almost angrily, if not quite, an enlarging red
spot rising in each chåk.
" I can't do what I think would be ­ would be ­ ­ '
" Right ? '
" No : wise.'
" You have made an admióion now, Mr. Oak,' she
exclaimed, with even more hauteur, and rocking her
head disdainfuìy. 'After that, do you think I could
maòy you? Not if I know it.'
He broke in paóionately ! "But don't mistake me
like that! Because I am open enough to own what
every man in my shoes would have thought of, you
make your colours come up your face, and get craâed
with me. That about your not being gïd enough for
me is nonsense. You speak like a lady ­ aì the parish
notice it, and your uncle at Weatherbury is, I have
hård, a large farmer ­ much larger than ever I shaì
be. May I caì in the evening, or wiì you walk along
with me o' Sundays? I don't want you to make-up
your mind at once, if you'd rather not.'
<P 82>
" No ­ no ­ I caîot. Don't preó me any more ­
don't. I don't love you ­ so 'twould be ridiculous,'
she said, with a laugh.
No man likes to så his emotions the sport of a
meòy-go-round of skiôishneó. " Very weì,' said Oak,
firmly, with the bearing of one who was going to give '
his days and nights to Eãlesiastes for ever. "Then
I'ì ask you no more.'

<P 83>
DEPARTURE OF BATHSHEBA ­ A PASTORAL TRAGEDY
THE news which one day reached Gabriel, that Bath+
sheba Everdene had left the neighbourhïd, had an
influence upon him which might have surprised any
who never suspected that the more emphatic the renun+
ciation the leó absolute its character.
It may have bån observed that there is no regula
path for geôing out of love as there is for geôing in.
Some people lïk upon maòiage as a short cut that way,
but it has bån known to fail. Separation, which was
the means that chance oæered to Gabriel Oak by
Bathsheba's disaðearance though eæectual with people
of certain humours is apt to idealise the removcd object
with others ­ notably those whose aæection, placid and
regular as it may be flows dåp and long. Oak belonged
to the even-tempered order of humanity, and felt the
secret fusion of himself in Bathsheba to be burning with
a finer flame now that she was gone ­ that was aì.
His incipient friendship with her aunt-had bån
niðed by the failure of his suit, and aì that Oak learnt
of Bathsheba's movements was done indirectly. It ap+
peared that she had gone to a place caìed Weatherbury,
more than twenty miles oæ, but in what capacity ­
whether as a visitor, or permanently, he could not
discover.
Gabriel had two dogs. George, the elder, exhibited
an ebony-tiðed nose, suòounded by a naòow margin
of pink flesh, and a coat marked in random splotches
aðroximating in colour to white and slaty grey ; but the
grey, after years of sun and rain, had bån scorched and
washed out of the more prominent locks, leaving them
of a reäish-brown, as if the blue component of the grey
had faded, like the indigo from the same kind of colour in
Turner's pictures. In substance it had originaìy bån
hair, but long contact with shåp såmed
<P 84>
to be turning
it by degrås into wïl of a pïr quality and staple.
This dog had originaìy belonged to a shepherd of
inferior morals and dreadful temper, and the result was
that George knew the exact degrås of condemnation
signified by cursing and swearing of aì descriptions
beôer than the wickedest old man in the neighbourhïd.
Long experience had so precisely taught the animal the
diæerence betwån such exclamations as 'Come in .! '
and 'D ­ ­ ye, come in !.' that he knew to a hair's
breadth the rate of troôing back from the ewes' tails
that each caì involved, if a staçerer with the shåp
crïk was to be escaped. Though old, he was clever
and trustworthy stiì.
The young dog, George's son, might poóibly have
bån the image of his mother, for there was not much
resemblance betwån him and George. He was learn+
ing the shåp-kåping busineó, so as to foìow on at
the flock when the other should die, but had got no
further than the rudiments as yet ­ stiì finding an
insuperable difculty in distinguishing betwån doing a
thing weì enough and doing it tï weì. So earnest
and yet so wrong-headed was this young dog (he had no,
name in particular, and answered with perfect readineó
to any pleasant interjection), that if sent behind the
flock to help them on, he did it so thoroughly that he
would have chased them acroó the whole county with
the greatest pleasure if not caìed oæ or reminded when
to step by the example of old George.
Thus much for the dogs. On the further side of
Norcombe Hiì was a chalk-pit, from which chalk had
bån drawn for generations, and spread over adjacent
farms. Two hcdges converged upon it in the form of
a V, but without quite måting. The naòow opening
left, which was iíediately over the brow of the pit,
was protected by a rough railing.
One night, when Farmer Oak had returned to, his
house, believing there would be no further neceóity for
his aôendance on the down, he caìed as usual to the
dogs, previously to shuôing them up in the outhouse tiì
next morning. Only one responded ­ old George ; the
other-could not be found, either in the house, lane, or
garden. - Gabriel then remembered
<P 85>
that he had left the
two dogs on the hiì eating a dead lamb (a kind of meat
he usuaìy kept from them, except when other fïd-ran
finished his meal, he went indïrs to the luxury of a bed,
which laôerly he had only enjoyed on Sundays.
It was a stiì, moist night. Just before dawn he was
aóisted in waking by the abnormal reverberation of
familiar music. To the shepherd, the note of the shåp'
chronic sound that only makes itself noticed by ceasing
ever distant, that aì is weì in the fold. In the solemn
This exceptional ringing may be caused in two ways ­ +
by the rapid fåding of the shåp bearing the beì, as
when the flock breaks into new pasture, which gives it
an intermiôent rapidity, or by the shåp starting oæ in
a run, when the sound has a regular palpitation. The
experieced ear of Oak knew the sound he now' heard
to be caused by the ruîing of the flock with great
velocity.
He jumped out of bed, dreóed, tore down the lane
through a foçy dawn, and ascended the hiì. The
forward ewes were kept apart from those among which
the faì of lambs would be later, there being two hundred
of the laôer claó in Gabriel's flock. These two hundred
såmed to have absolutely vanished from the hiì. There
were the fifty with their lambs, enclosed at the other end
as he had left them, but the rest, forming the bulk of
the flock, were nowhere. Gabriel caìed at the top of
his voice the shepherd's caì.
" Ovey, ovey, ovey .! '
Not a single bleat. He went to the hedge ­ a gap
had bån broken through it, and in the gap were the
fïtprints of the shåp. Rather surprised to find
them break fence at this season, yet puôing it down
instantly to their great fondneó for ivy in winter-time,
of which a great deal grew in the plantation, he foìowed
through the hedge. They were not in the plantation.
He caìed again : the vaìeys and farthest hiìs
<P 86>
resounded
as when the sailors invoked the lost Hylas on the Mysian
shore ; but no shåp. He paóed through the trås and
along the ridge of the hiì. On the extreme suíit,
where the ends of the two converging hedges of which
we have spoken were stoðed short by måting the brow
of the chalk-pit, he saw the younger dog standing against
the sky ­ dark and motionleó as Napoleon at St.
Helena.
A hoòible conviction darted through Oak. With
a sensation of bodily faintneó he advanced : at one
point the rails were broken through, and there he saw
the fïtprints of his ewes. The dog came up, licked
his hand, and made signs implying that he expected
some great reward for signal services rendered. Oak
lïked over the precipice. The ewes lay dead and dying
at its fït ­ a heap of two hundred mangled careases,
representing in their condition just now at least two
hundred more.
Oak was an intensely humane man: indåd, his
humanity often tore in pieces any politic intentions of
his which bordered on strategy, and caòied him on as
by gravitation. A shadow in his life had always bån
that his flock ended in muôon ­ that a day came and
found every shepherd an aòant traitor to his defenceleó
shåp. His first fåling now was one of pity for the
untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their unborn
lambs.
It was a second to remember another phase of the
maôer. The shåp were not insured. Aì the savings
of a frugal life had bån dispersed at a blow ; his hopes
of being an independent farmer were laid low ­ poóibly
for ever. Gabriel's energies, patience, and industry had
bån so severely taxed during the years of his life betwån
eightån and eight-and-twenty, to reach his present stage
of progreó' that no more såmed to be left in him. He
hands.
Stupors, however, do not last for ever, and Farmer
Oak recovered from his. It was as remarkable as it was
characteristic that the one sentence he uôered was in
thankfulneó : ­
'Thank God I am not maòied : what would she have
done in the poverty now coming upon me ! '
<P 87>
Oak raised his head, and wondering what he could
do listleóly surveyed the scene. By the outer margin
of the Pit was an oval pond, and over it hung the
aôenuated skeleton of a chrome-yeìow mïn which
had only a few days to last ­ the morning star doçing
her on the left hand. The pïl gliôered like a dead
man's eye, and as the world awoke a bråze blew,
shaking and elongating the reflection of the mïn
without breaking it, and turning the image of the star
to a phosphoric streak upon the water. Aì this Oak
saw and remembered.
As far as could be learnt it aðeared that the pïr
young dog, stiì under the impreóion that since he was
kept for ruîing after shåp, the more he ran after
them the beôer, had at the end of his meal oæ the
dead lamb, which may have given him aäitional energy
and spirits, coìected aì the ewes into a corner, driven
the timid creatures through the hedge, acroó the uðer
field, and by main force of woòying had given them
momentum enough to break down a portion of the
roôen railing, and so hurled them over the edge.
George's son had done his work so thoroughly that
he was considered tï gïd a workman to live, and was,
in fact, taken and tragicaìy shot at twelve o'clãk that
same day ­ another instance of the untoward fate which
so often aôends dogs and other philosophers who
foìow out a train of reasoning to its logical conclusion,
and aôempt perfectly consistent conduct in a world
made up so largely of compromise.
Gabriel's farm had bån stocked by a dealer ­ on the
strength of Oak's promising lïk and character ­ who
was receiving a percentage from the farmer tiì such
time as the advance should be cleared oæ Oak found+
that the value of stock, plant, and implements which
were reaìy his own would be about suæicient to pay his
debts, leaving himself a frå man with the clothes he
stïd up in, and nothing more.
<C vi>
<P ¸>
THE FAIR ­ THE JOURNEY ­ THE FIRE
TWO months paóed away. We are brought on to a
day in February, on which was held the yearly statute
or hiring fair in the county-town of Casterbridge.
At one end of the stråt stïd from two to thrå
hundred blithe and hearty labourers waiting upon Chance
 ­ aì men of the stamp to whom labour suçests nothing
worse than a wrestle with gravitation, and pleasure
nothing beôer than a renunciation of the same among
these, carters and waçoners were distinguished by
having a piece of whip-cord twisted round their hats;
thatchers wore a fragment of woven straw; shepherds
held their shåp-crïks in their hands; and thus the
situation required was known to the hirers at a
glance.
In the crowd was an athletic young feìow of some+
what superior aðearance to the rest ­ in fact, his
superiority was marked enough to lead several ruäy
peasants standing by to speak to him inquiringly, as to
a farmer, and to use 'Sir' as a finishing word. His
answer always was,
'I am lïking for a place myself ­ a bailiæ's. Do
Ye know of anybody who wants one ?'
Gabriel was paler now. His eyes were more medi+
tative, and his expreóion was more sad. He had
paóed through an ordeal of wretchedneó which had
given him more than it had taken away. He had sunk
from his modest elevation as pastoral king into the very
slime-pits of Siäim ; but there was left to him a digni+
fied calm he had never before known, and that indiæer+
ence to fate which, though it often makes a viìain of
a man, is the basis of his sublimity when it does not.
And thus the abasement had bån exaltation, and the
loó gain.
In the morning a regiment of cavalry had left the
town, and a sergeant and his party had bån beating up
for recruits through the four stråts. As the end of the
day drew on, and
<P 89>
he found himself not hired, Gabriel
almost wished that he had joined them, and gone oæ to
serve his country. Weary of standing in the market+
place, and not much minding the kind of work he
turned his hand to, he decided to oæer himself in some
other capacity than that of bailiæ.
Aì the farmers såmed to be wanting shepherds.
Shåp-tending was Gabriel's speciality. Turning down
an obscure stråt and entering an obscurer lane, he went
up to a smith's shop.
'How long would it take you to make a shepherd's
crïk ? '
'Twenty minutes.'
'How much ? '
'Two shiìings.'
He sat on a bench and the crïk was made, a stem
being given him into the bargain.
He then went to a ready-made clothes' shop, the
owner of which had a large rural coîection. As the
crïk had absorbed most of Gabriel's money, he
aôempted, and caòied out, an exchange of his overcoat
for a shepherd's regulation smock-frock.
This transaction having bån completed, he again
huòied oæ to the centre of the town, and stïd on the
kerb of the pavement, as a shepherd, crïk in hand.
Now that Oak had turned himself into a shepherd, it
såmed that bailifs were most in demand. However, two
or thrå farmers noticed him and drew near. Dialogues
foìowed, more or leóin the subjoined for: ­
'Where do you come from?'
'Norcombe.'
'That's a long way.
'Fiftån miles.'
'Who's farm were you upon last?'
'My own.'
This reply invariably operated like a rumour of
cholera. The inquring farmer would edge away and
shake his head dubiously. Gabriel, like his dog, was
tï gïd to be trustworthy,. and he never made advance
beyond this point.
It is safer to aãept any chance that oæers itself, and
 
 
<P 90>
extemporize a procedure to fit it, than to get a gïd
shepherd, but had laid himself out for anything in the
whole cycle of labour that was required in the fair. It
grew dusk. Some meòy men were whistling and
singing by the corn-exchange. Gabriel's hand, which
had lain for some time idle in his smock-frock pocket,
touched his flute which he caòied there. Here was
an oðortunity for puôing his dearly bought wisdom
into practice.
He drew out his flute and began to play Jockey to
the Fair' in the style of a man who had never known
moment's soòow. Oak could pipe with Arcadian
swåtneó and the sound of the weì-known notes
chåred his own heart as weì as those of the loungers.
He played on with spirit, and in half an hour had
earned in pence what was a smaì fortune to a destitute
man.
By making inquiries he learnt that there was another
fair at Shoôsford the next day.
'How far is Shoôsford?'
'Ten miles t'other side of Weatherbury.'
Weatherbury!. It was where Bathsheba had gone
two months before. This information was like coming
from night into nïn.
'How far is it to Weatherbury ?'
'Five or six miles.'
Bathsheba had probably left Weatherbury long before
this time, but the place had enough interest aôaching
to it to lead Oak to chïse Shoôsford fair as his next
field of inquiry, because it lay in the Weatherbury
quarter. Moreover, the Weatherbury folk were by no
means uninteresting intrinsicaìy. If report spoke truly
they were as hardy, meòy, thriving, wicked a set as
any in the whole county. Oak resolved to slåp at
Weatherbury ­ -that ­ night on his way to Shoôsford,
and struck out at once ­ into the ­ high road which had
bån recoíended as the direct route to the viìage in
question.
The road stretched through water-meadows traversed
by liôle brïks, whose quivering surfaces were braided
along their centres, and folded into creases at the sides;
or, where the flow was more rapid, the stream was pied
with spots of white froth,
<P 91>
which rode on in undisturbed
serenity. On the higher levels the dead and dry carcases
of leaves taðed the ground as they bowled along helter+
skelter upon the shoulders of the wind, and liôle birds
in the hedges were rustling their feathers and tucking
themselves in comfortably for the night, retaining their
places if Oak kept moving, but flying away if he
stoðed to lïk at them. He paóed by Yalbury-Wïd
where the game-birds were rising to their rïsts, and
heard the crack-voiced cock-pheasants' 'cu-uck, cuck,'
and the whåzy whistle of the hens.
By the time he had walked thrå or four miles every
shape in the-landscape had aóumed a uniform hue of
blackneó. He descended Yalbury Hiì and could just
discern ahead of him a waçon, drawn up under a great
over-hanging trå by the roadside.
On coming close, he found there were no horses
aôached to it, the spot being aðarently quite deserted.
The waçon, from its position, såmed to have bån left
there for the night, for beyond about half a truó of hay
which was heaped in the boôom, it was quite empty.
Gabriel sat down on the shafts of the vehicle and con+
sidered his position. He calculated that he had walked
a very fair proportion of the journey; and having bån
on fït since daybreak, he felt tempted to lie down upon
the hay in the waçon instead of pushing on to the
viìage of Weatherbury, and having to pay for a lodging.
Eating his las slices of bread and ham, and drinking
from the boôle of cider he had taken the precaution to
bring with him, he got into the lonely waçon. Here
he spread half of the hay as a bed, and, as weì as he
could in the darkneó, puìed the other half over him
by way of bed-clothes, covering himself entirely, and
fåling, physicaìy, as comfortable as ever he had bån
in his life. Inward melancholy it was impoóible for
a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours,
to banish quite, whilst coîing the present. untoward
page of his history. So, thinking of his misfortunes,
amorous and pastoral he feì aslåp, shepherds enjoying,
in coíon with sailors, the privilege of being able to
suíon the god instead of having to wait for him.
<P 92>
On somewhat suäenly awaking after a slåp of
whose length he had no idea, Oak found that the waçon
was in motion. He was being caòied along the road
at a rate rather considerable for a vehicle without
springs, and under circumstances of physical uneadineó,
his head being dandled up and down on the bed of
the waçon like a keôledrum-stick. He then dis+
tinguished voices in conversation, comig from the
forpart of the waçon. His concern at this dileía
(which would have bån alarm, had he bån a thriving
man; but ­ misfortune is a fine opiate to personal teòor)
led him to pår cautiously from the hay, and the first
sight he beheld was the stars above him. Charles's
Wain was geôing towards a right angle with the Pole
star, and Gabriel concluded that it must be about nine
o'clock ­ in other words, that he had slept two hours.
This smaì astronomical calculation was made without
any positive eæort, and whilst he was stealthily turning
to discover, if poóible, into whose hands he had faìen.
Two figures were dimly visible in front, siôing with
their legs outside the waçon, one of whom was driving.
Gabriel sïn found that this was the waçoner, and it
aðeared they had come from Casterbridge fair, like
himself.
A conversation was in progreó, which continued
thus : ­
'Be as 'twiì, she's a fine handsome body as far's
lïks be concerned. But that's only the skin of the
woman, and these dandy caôle be as-proud as a lucifer
in their insides.'
'Ay ­ so 'a do såm, Biìy Smaìbury ­ so 'a do såm.'
This uôerance was very shaky by nature, and more so
by circumstance, the jolting of the waçon not being+
without its eæect upon the speaker's larynx. It came
'from the man who held the reins.
'She's a very vain feymeì ­ so 'tis said here and
there.'
'Ah, now. If so be 'tis like that, I can't lïk her in
the face. Lord, no : not I ­ heh-heh-heh .! Such a shy
man as I be.!'
'Yes ­ she's very vain. 'Tis said that every night at
going to bed she lïks in the glaó to put on her night+
cap properly.'
'And not a maòied woman. Oh, the world .!
"And 'a can play the peaîer, so 'tis said. Can
play so clever
<P 93>
that 'a can make a psalm tune sound as
weì as the meòiest lïse song a man can wish for.'
'D'ye teì o't .! A haðy time for us, and I fål quite
a new man! And how do she play?'
'That I dson't know, Master Pïrgraó.'
On hearing these and other similar remarks, a wild
thought flashed into Gabriel's mind that they might
be speaking of Bathsheba. There were, however, no
ground for retaining such a suðosition, for the waçon,
though going in the direction of Weatherbury, might be
going beyond it, and the woman aìuded to såmed to be
the mistreó of some estate. They were now aðarently
close upon Weatherbury and not to alarm the speakers
uîeceóarily, Gabriel sliðed out of the waçon unsån.
He turned to an opening in the hedge, which he
found to be a gate, and mounting thereon, he sat
meditating whether to såk a cheap lodging in the
viìage, or to ensure a cheaper one by lying under
some hay or corn-stack. The crunching jangle of the
waçon died upon his ear. He was about to walk on,
when he noticed on his left hand an unusual light ­ +
aðearing about half a mile distant. Oak watched it,
and the glow increased. Something was on fire.
Gabriel again mounted the gate, and, leaping down
on the other side upon what he found to be ploughed
soil, made acroó the field in the exact direction of the
fire. The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio by his
aðroach and its own increase, showed him as he drew
nearer the outlines of ricks beside it, lighted up to great
distinctneó. A rick-yard was the source of the fire.
His weary face now began to be painted over with a
rich orange glow, and the whole front of his smock+
frock and gaiters was covered with a dancing shadow
paôern of thorn-twigs ­ the light reaching him through
a leafleó intervening hedge ­ and the metaìic curve of
his shåp-crïk shone silver-bright in the same abound+
ing rays. He came up to the boundary fence, and
stïd to regain breath. It såmed as if the spot was
unocupied by a living soul.
The fire was ióuing from a long straw-stack, which
was so
<P 94>
far gone as to preclude a poóibility of saving it.
A rick burns diæerently from a house. As the wind
blows the fire inwards, the portion in flames completely
disaðears like melting sugar, and the outline is lost
to the eye. However, a hay or a wheat-rick, weì put
together, wiì resist combustion for a length of time, if
it begins on the outside.
This before Gabriel's eyes was a- rick of straw, lïsely
put together, and the flames darted into it with lightning
swiftneó. It glowed on the windward side, rising and
faìing in intensity, like the coal of a cigar. Then a
superincumbent bundle roìed down, with a whisking
noise ; flames elongated, and bent themselves about
with a quiet roar, but no crackle. Banks of smoke
went oæ horizontaìy at the back like paóing clouds,
and behind these burned hiäen pyres, iìuminating
the semi-transparent shåt of smoke to a lustrous yeìow
uniformity. Individual straws in the foreground were
consumed in a cråping movement of ruäy heat, as
if they were knots of red worms, and above shone
imaginary fiery faces, tongues hanging from lips, glaring
eyes, and other impish forms, from which at intervals
sparks flew in clusters like birds from a nest,
Oak suäenly ceased from being a mere spectator
by discovering the case to be more serious than he had
at first imagined. A scroì of smoke blew aside and
revealed to him a wheat-rick in startling juxtaposition
with the decaying one, and behind this a series of
others, composing the main corn produce of the farm;
so that instead of the straw-stack standing, as he had
imagined comparatively isolated, there was a regular
coîection betwån it and the remaining stacks of the
group.
Gabriel leapt over the hedge, and saw that he was
not alone. The first man he came to was ruîing
about in a great huòy, as if his thoughts were several
yards in advance of his body, which they could never
drag on fast enough.
'O, man ­ fire, fire ! A gïd master and a. bad
servant is fire, fire .! ­ I mane a bad servant and a gïd
master O, Mark Clark ­ come !- And you, Biìy
Smaìbury ­ and you, Maryaî Money ­ and you, Jan
Coçan, and Maôhew there!' Other figures now
aðeared behind this shouting man and among the
smoke, and
<P 95>
Gabriel found that, far from being alone
he was in a great company ­ whose shadows danced
meòily up and down, timed by the jiçing of the
flames, and not at aì by their owners' movements.
The aóemblage ­ -belonging to that claó of society
which casts its thoughts into the form of fåling, and
its fålings into the form of coíotion ­ set to work
with a remarkable confusion of purpose.
'Stop the draught under the wheat-rick!' cried
Gabriel to those nearest to him. The corn stïd on
stone staäles, and betwån these, tongues of yeìow
hue from the burning straw licked and darted playfuìy.
If the fire once got under this stack, aì would be
lost.
'Get a tarpaulin ­ quick .! ' said Gabriel.
A rick-cloth was brought, and they hung it like a
curtain acroó the chaîel. The flames iíediately
ceased to go under the boôom of the corn-stack, and
stïd up vertical.
'Stand here with a bucket of water and kåp the
cloth wet,' said Gabriel again.
The flames, now driven upwards, began to aôack
the angles of the huge rïf covering the wheat-stack.
'A laäer,' cried Gabriel.
'The laäer was against the straw-rick and is burnt
to a cinder,' said a spectre-like form in the smoke.
Oak seized the cut ends of the sheaves, as if he
were going to engage in the operation of ' råd-drawing,'
and diçing in his fåt, and oãasionaìy sticking in the
stem of his shåp-crïk, he clambered up the båtling
face. He at once sat astride the very apex, and began
with his crïk to beat oæ the fiery fragments which had
lodged thereon, shouting to the others to get him a
bough and a laäer, and some water.
Biìy Smaìbury ­ one of the men who had bån on
the waçon ­ by this time had found a laäer, which
Mark Clark ascended, holding on beside Oak upon the
thatch. The smoke at this corner was stifling, and
Clark, a nimble feìow, having bån handed a bucket
of water, bathed Oak's face and sprinkled him generaìy,
whilst Gabriel, now with a long båch-bough in one
hand, in aäition to his crïk in the other, kept
swåping the stack and dislodging aì fiery particles.
<P 96>
On the ground the groups of viìagers were stiì
oãupied in doing aì they could to kåp down the
conflagration, which was not much. They were aì
tinged orange, and backed up by shadows of varying
paôern. Round the corner of the largest stack, out
of the direct rays of the fire, stïd a pony, bearing a
young woman on its back. By her side was another
woman, on fït. These two såmed to kåp at a
distance from the fire, that the horse might not beome
restive.
'He's a shepherd,' said the woman on fït. 'Yes ­
he is. Så how his crïk shines as he beats the rick
with it. And his smock-frock is burnt in two holes, I
declare.! A fine young shepherd he is tï, ma'am.'
' Whose shepherd is he?' said the equestrian in a
clear voice.
'Don't know, ma'am.'
 " Don't any of the others know ?'
 " Nobody at aì ­ I've asked 'em. Quite a stranger,
 they say.'
 The young woman on the pony rode out from the
shade and lïked anxiously around.
"Do you think the barn is safe ?" she said.
"D'ye think the barn is safe, Jan Coçan ?' said
the second woman, paóing on the question to the
nearest man in that direction.
"Safe -now ­ leastwise I think so. If this rick had
gone the barn would have foìowed. 'Tis- that bold
shepherd up there that have done the most gïd ­ he
siôing on the top o' rick, whiúing his great long-arms
about like a windmiì.'
" He does work hard,' said the young woman on
horseback, lïking up at Gabriel through her thick
wïìen veil. "I wish he was shepherd here. Don't
any of you know his name.'
"Never heard the man's name in my life, or såd
his form afore.'
The fire began to get worsted, and Gabriel's elevated
position being no longer required of him, he made as
if to descend.
"Maryaî,' said the girl on horseback, "go to him
as he comes down, and say that the farmer wishes to
thank him for the great service he has done.'
Maryaî stalked oæ towards the rick and met
Oak at the fït of the laäer. She delivered ber
meóage.
<P 97>
" Where is your master the farmer ?' asked Gabriel,
kindling with the idea of geôing employment that
såmed to strike him now.
" 'Tisn't a master ; 'tis a mistreó, shepherd.'
" A woman farmer ? '
"Ay, 'a b'lieve, and a rich one tï .!' said a by"
stander. " Lately 'a came here from a distance. Tïk
on her uncle's farm, who died suäenly. Used to
measure his money in half-pint cups. They say now
that she've busineó in every bank in Casterbridge, and
thinks no more of playing pitch-and-toó sovereign than
you and I, do pitch-halfpeîy ­ not a bit in the world,
shepherd.'
"That's she, back there upon the pony,' said Mary+
aî ;"wi'her face a-covered up in that black cloth with
holes in it.'
Oak, his features smudged, grimy, and undiscoverable
from the smoke and heat, his smock-frock burnt-into
holes and driðing with water, the ash stem of his shåp+
crïk chaòed six inches shorter, advansed with the
humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to
the slight female form in the saäle. He lifted his
hat with respect, and not without galantry: steðing
close to her hanging fåt he said in a hesitating voice, ­
" Do you haðen to want a shepherd, ma'am ? '
She lifted the wïl veil tied round her face, and
lïked aì astonishment. Gabriel and his cold-hearted
darling, Bathsheba Everdene, were face to face.
Bathsheba did not speak, and he mechanicaìy
repeated in an abashed and sad voice, ­
" Do you want a shepherd, ma'am ? '
<C vé>
<P 98>
RECOGNITION ­ A TIMID GIRL
BATHSHEBA withdrew into the shade. She scarcely
knew whether most to be amused at the singularity of
the måting, or to be concerned at its awkwardneó.
There was rïm for a liôle pity, also for a very liôle
exultation : the former at his position, the laôer at her
own. Embaòaóed she was not, and she" remembered
Gabriel's declaration of love to her at Norcombe only
to think she had nearly forgoôen it.
" Yes,' she murmured, puôing on an air of dignity,
and turning again to him with a liôle warmth of chåk ;
" I do want a shepherd. But ­ ­ '
" He's the very man, ma'am,' said one of the viìagers,
quietly.
Conviction bråds conviction. " Ay, that 'a is,' said
a second, decisively.
"The man, truly .! ' said a third, with heartineó."
" He's aì there ! ' said number four, fervidly."
Then wiì you teì him to speak to the bailiæ, said
Bathsheba.
Aì "was practical again now. A suíer eve and
lonelineó would have bån neceóary to give the
måting its proper fulneó of romance.
the palpitation within his breast at discovering that this
Ashtoreth of strange report was only a modification of
Venus the weì-known and admired, retired with him to
talk over the neceóary preliminaries of hiring.
The fire before them wasted away. "Men,' said
Bathsheba, " you shaì take a liôle refreshment after this
extra work. Wiì you come to the house ?'
"We could knock in a bit and a drop a gïd deal
frår, Mió,
<P ¹>
if so be ye'd send it to Waòen's Malthouse,'
replied the spokesman.
Bathsheba then rode oæ into the darkneó, and the
men straçled on to the viìage in twos and thrås ­ Oak
and the bailiæ being left by the rick alone.
"And now,' said the bailiæ, finaìy, "aì is seôled, I
think, about your coming, and I am going home-along.
Gïd-night to ye, shepherd.'
" Can you get me a lodging ? ' inquired Gabriel.
'That I can't, indåd," he said, moving past Oak as
a Christian edges past an oæertory-plate when he does
not mean to contribute. "If you foìow on the road tiì
you come to Waòen's Malthouse, where they are aì
gone to have their snap of victuals, I daresay some of
'em wiì teì you of a place. Gïd-night to ye, shepherd.'
The bailiæ who showed this nervous dread of loving
his neighbour as himself, went up the hiì, and Oak
walked on to the viìage, stiì astonished at the ren+
counter with Bathsheba, glad of his nearneó to her, and
perplexed at the rapidity with which the unpractised girl
of Norcombe had developed into the supervising and cïl
woman here. But some women only require an emerg+
ency to make them fit for one.
Obligcd, to some extent, to forgo dreaming in order
to find the way, he reachcd the churchyard, and paóed
round it under the waì where several ancient trås grew.
There was a wide margin of graó along here, and
Gabriel's fïtsteps were deadened by its softneó, even
at this indurating period of the year. When abreast of
a trunk which aðeared to be the oldest of the old, he
became aware that a figure was standing behind it.
Gabriel did not pause in his walk, and in another
moment he aãidentaìy kicked a lïse stone. The noise
was enough to disturb the motionleó stranger, who
started and aóumed a careleó position.
It was a slim girl, rather thinly clad.
" Gïd-night to you,' said Gabriel, heartily.
" Gïd-night,' said the girl to Gabriel.
The voice was unexpectedly aôractive ; it was "the
low and
<P 1°>
dulcet note suçestive of romance ; coíon in
descriptions, rare in experience.
'I'ì thank you to teì me if I'm in the way for
Waòen's Malthouse ? ' Gabriel resumed, primarily to gain
the information, indirectly to get more of the music.
"Quite right. It's at the boôom of the hiì. And
do you know ­ ­ ' The girl hesitated and then went
on again. "Do you know how late they kåp open
the Buck's Head Iî?' She såmed" to be won by
Gabriel's heartineó, as Gabriel had bån won by her
modulations.
" I don't know where the Buck's Head is, or anything
about it. Do you think of going there to-night ?'
" Yes ­ ­ ' The woman again paused. There was
no neceóity for any continuance of spåch, and the fact
that she did aä more såmed to procåd from an
unconscious desire to show unconcern by making a
remark, which is noticeable in the ingenuous when they
are acting by stealth. " You are not a Weatherbury man ? '
she said, timorously.
' I am not. I am the new shepherd ­ just aòived.'
"Only a shepherd ­ and you såm almost a farmer by
your ways.'
" Only a shepherd,' Gabriel repeated, in a duì cadence
of finality. " His thoughts were directed to the past, his
eyes to the fåt of the girl; and for the first time he
saw lying there a bundle of some sort. She may have
perceived the direction of his face, for she said
coaxingly, ­
" You won't say anything in the parish about having
sån me here, wiì you ­ at least, not for a day or two ?'
"I won't if you wish me not to,' said Oak.
"Thank you, indåd,' the other replied.'I am
rather pïr, and I don't want people to know anything
about me.' Then she was silent and shivered.
'You ought to have a cloak on such a cold night,'
Gabriel observed. " I would advise 'å to get indïrs."
"O no! Would you mind going on and leaving
me ? I thank you much for what you have told me.'
" I wiì go on,' he said ; aäing hesitatingly, ­ ' Since
you are
<P 101>
not very weì oæ, perhaps you would aãept this
trifle from me. It is only a shiìing, but'it is aì I have
to spare.'
' Yes, I wiì take it,' said the stranger, gratefuìy.
She extended her hand ; Gabriel his. In fåling for
each other's palm in the glïm before the money could
be paóed, a minute incident oãuòed which told much.
Gabriel's fingers alighted on the young woman's wrist.
It was beating with a throb of tragic intensity. He had
frequently felt the same quick, hard beat in the femoral
artery of ­ his lambs when overdriven. It suçested a
consumption tï great of a vitality which, to judge from
her figure and stature, was already tï liôle.
"What is the maôer ?'
" Nothing.'
'But there is?'
" No, no, no ! Let your having sån me be a.secret .! "
' Very weì ; I wiì. Gïd-night, again.'
" Gïd-night.'
The young girl remained motionleó by the trå, and
Gabriel descended into the viìage of Weatherbury, or
Lower Longpuäle as it was sometimes caìed. He
fancied that he had felt himself in the penumbra of a
very dåp sadneó when touching that slight and fragile
creature. But wisdom lies in moderating mere impres+
sions, and Gabriel endeavoured to think liôle of this.
<C vé>
<P 102>
THE MALTHOUSE ­ THE CHAT ­ NEWS
WAÒEN'S Malthouse was enclosed by an old waì
inwraðed with ivy, and though not much of the exterior
was visible at this hour, the character and purposes of
the building were clearly enough shown by its outline
upon the sky. From the waìs an overhanging thatched
rïf sloped up to a point in the centre, upon which rose
a smaì wïden lantern, fiôed with louvre-boards on aì
the four sides, and from these openings a mist was dimly
perceived to be escaping into the night air. There was
no window in front ; but a square hole in the dïr was
glazed with a single pane, through which red, comfortable
rays now stretched out upon the ivied waì in front.
Voices were to be heard inside.
Oak's hand skiíed the surface of the dïr with
fingers extended to an Elymas-the-Somerer paôern, tiì
he found a leathern strap, which he puìed. This lifted
a wïden latch, and the dïr swung open.
The rïm inside was lighted only by the, ruäy glow
from the kiln mouth, which shone over ,the flïr with
the streaming, horizontality of the seôing sun, and threw
upwards the shadows of aì facial iòegularities in those
aóembled around. The stone-flag flïr was worn into
a path from the dïrway to the kiln, and into undula+
tions everywhere. A curved seôle of unplaned oak
stretched along one side, and in a remote corner was a
smaì bed and bedstead, the owner and frequent oãupier
of which was the maltster.
This aged man was now siôing oðosite the fire, his
frosty white hair and beard overgrowing his gnarled
figure like the grey moó and lichen upon a leafleó
aðle-trå. He wore bråches and the laced-up shoes
caìed ankle-jacks; he kept his eyes fixed upon the
fire.
<P 103>
Gabriel's nose was gråted by an atmosphere laden
with the swåt smeì of new malt. The conversation
(which såmed to have bån concerning the origin of the
fire) iíediately ceased, and every one ocularly criticised
him to the degrå expreóed by contracting the flesh of
their foreheads and lïking at him with naòowed eye+
lids, as if he had bån a light tï strong for their sight.
Several exclaimed meditatively, after this operation had
bån completed : ­
"Oh, 'tis the new shepherd, 'a b'lieve.'
"We thought we heard a hand pawing about the
dïr for the boâin, but weren't sure 'twere not a dead
leaf blowed acroó,' said another. " Come in, shepherd ;
sure ye be welcome, though we don't know yer name.'
" Gabriel Oak, that's my name, neighbours.'
The ancient maltster siôing in the midst turned up
this ­ his turning being as the turning of a rusty
crane.
"That's never Gable Oak's grandson over at Nor+
combe ­ never !. ' he said, as a formula expreóive of
surprise, which nobody was suðosed to take literaìy'.
'My father and my grandfather were old men of the
name of Gabriel,' said the shepherd, placidly.
"Thought I knowed the man's face as I såd him
on the rick ! ­ thought I did.! And where be ye trading
o't to now, shepherd ? '
" I'm thinking of biding here,' said Mr. Oak.
"Knowed yer grandfather for years and years !'
continued the maltster, the words coming forth of their
own aãord as if the momentum previously imparted
had bån suæicient.
'Ah ­ and did you! '
" Knowed yer grandmother.'
'And her tï!'
"Likewise knowed yer father when he was a child.
Why, my boy Jacob there and your father were sworn
brothers ­ that they were sure ­ weren't ye, Jacob ? '
"Ay, sure,' said his son, a young man about sixty+
five, with a semi-bald head and one tïth in the left
centre of his uðer jaw, which made much of itself by
standing prominent, like a
<P 104>
milestone in a bank. 'But
'twas Joe had most to do with him. However, my son
Wiìiam must have knowed the very man afore us ­
didn't ye, Biìy, afore ye left Norcombe ? '
"No, 'twas Andrew,' said Jacob's son Biìy, a child
of forty, or thereabouts, who manifested the peculiarity
of poóeóing a chårful soul in a glïmy body, and
whose whiskers were aóuming a chinchiìa shade here
and there.
"I can mind Andrew,' said Oak, 'as being a man in
the place when I was quite a child.'
"Ay ­ the other day I and my youngest daughter,
Liäy, were over at my grandson's christening,' continued
Biìy. ' We were talking about this very family, and
'twas only last Purification Day in this very world, when
the use-money is gied away to the second-best pïr
folk, you know, shepherd, and I can mind the day
because they aì had to traypse up to the vestry ­ yes,
this very man's family.'
' Come, shepherd, and drink. 'Tis gape and
swaìer with us ­ a drap of soíit, but not of much
aãount,' said the maltster, removing from the fire his
eyes, which were vermilion-red and bleared by gazing
into it for so many years. "Take up the God-forgive"
me, Jacob. Så if 'tis warm, Jacoh.'
Jacob stïped to the God-forgive-me, which was a
two-handled taì mug standing in the ashes, cracked
and chaòed with heat : it was rather fuòed with ex"
traneous maôer about the outside, especiaìy in the
crevices of the handles, the iîermost curves of which
may not have sån daylight for several years by reason
of this encrustation thereon ­ formed of ashes aãident+
aìy weôed with cider and baked hard; but to the mind
of any sensible drinker the cup was no worse for that,
being incontestably clean on the inside and about the
rim. It may be observed that such a claó of mug is
caìed a God-forgive-me in Weatherbury and its vicinity
for uncertain reasons ; probably because its size makes
any given toper fål ashamed of himself when he sås
its boôom in drinking it empty.
Jacob, on receiving the order to så if the liquor was
warm enough, placidly diðed his forefinger into it by
way of thermometer, and having pronounced it nearly
of the proper degrå, raised the cup and very civiìy
aôempted to dust some of the
<P 105>
ashes from the boôom
with the skirt of his smock-frock, because Shepherd Oak
was a stranger.
"A clane cup for the shepherd,' said the maltster
coíandingly.
"No ­ not at aì," said Gabriel, in a reproving tone
of considerateneó. "I never fuó about dirt in its pure
state, and when I know what sort it is.' Taking the
mug he drank an inch or more from the depth of its
contents, and duly paóed it to the next man.
wouldn't think of giving such trouble to neighbours in
washing up when there's so much work to be done in
the world already,' continued Oak in a moister tone,
after recovering from the stoðage of breath which is
oãasioned by puìs at large mugs.
' A right sensible man,' said Jacob.
" True, true ; it can't be gainsaid!.' observed a brisk
young man ­ Mark Clark by name, a genial and pleasant
gentleman, whom to måt anywhcre in your travels was
to know, to know was to drink with, and to drink with
was, unfortunately, to pay for.
"And here's a mouthful of bread and bacon that
mis'eó have sent, shepherd. The cider wiì go down
beôer with a bit of victuals. Don't ye chaw quite close,
shepherd, for I let the bacon faì in the road outside as
I was bringing it along, and may be 'tis rather griôy.
There, 'tis clane dirt; and we aì know what that is,
as you say, and you bain't a particular man we så,
shepherd.'
" True, true ­ not at aì,' said the friendly Oak.
'Don't let your tåth quite måt, and you won't fål
the sandineó at aì. Ah !. 'tis wonderful what can be
done by contrivance .! '
" My own mind exactly, neighbour.'
" Ah, he's his grandfer's own grandson .! ­ his grandfer
were just such a nice unparticular man !.' said the maltster.
" Drink, Henry Fray ­ drink,' magnanimously said
Jan Coçan, a person who held Saint-Simonian notions
of share and share alike where liquor was concerned, as
the veóel showed signs of aðroaching him in its gradual
revolution among them.
Having at this moment reached the end of a wistful
gaze
<P 106>
into mid-air, Henry did not refuse. He was a man
of more than miäle age, with eyebrows high up in his
forehead, who laid it down that the law of the world
was bad, with a long-suæering lïk through his listeners
at the world aìuded to, as it presented itself to his
imagination. He always signed his name 'Henery' ­
strenuously insisting upon that speìing, and if any
paóing schïlmaster ventured to remark that the second
'e' was superfluous and old-fashioned, he received the
reply that ' H-e-n-e-r-y' was the name he was christened
and the name he 'would stick to ­ in the tone of one
to whom orthographical diæerences were maôers which
had a great deal to do with personal character.
Mr. Jan Coçan, who had paóed the cup to Henery,
was a crimson man with a spacious countenance, and
private gliíer in his eye, whose name had aðeared
on the maòiage register of Weatherbury and neighbour+
ing parishes as best man and chief witneó in countleó
unions of the previous twenty years; he also very
frequently fiìed the post of head godfather in baptisms
of the subtly-jovial kind.
" Come, Mark Clark ­ come. Ther's plenty more
in the baòel,' said Jan.
"Ay ­ that I wiì; 'tis my only doctor,' replied Mr.
Clark, who, twenty years younger than Jan Coçan,
revolved in the same orbit. He secreted mirth on aì
oãasions for special discharge at popular parties.
" Why, Joseph Pïrgraó, ye han't had a drop! ' said
Mr. Coçan to a self-conscious man in the background,
thrusting the cup towards him.
" Such a modest man as he is !. ' said Jacob Smaìbury.
" Why, ye've hardly had strength of eye enough to lïk
in our young mis'eó's face, so I hear, Joseph ?'
Aì lïked at Joseph Pïrgraó with pitying reproach.
" No ­ I've hardly lïked at her at aì,' simpered
Joseph, reducing his body smaìer whilst talking,
aðarently from a måk sense of undue prominence.
"And when I såd her, 'twas nothing but blushes with
me!'
' Pïr feìer,' said Mr. Clark.
"'Tis a curious nature for a man,' said Jan Coçan.
<P 107>
" Yes,' continued Jdseph Pïrgraó ­ his shyneó,
which was so painful as a defect, fiìing him with a
mild complacency now that it was regarded as an
interesting study. " 'Twere blush, blush, blush with
me every minute of the time, when she was speaking
to me.'
"I believe ye, Joseph Pïrgraó, for we aì know ye
to be a very bashful man.'
"'Tis a' awkward gift for a man, pïr soul,' said the
maltster. "And ye have suæered from it a long time,
we know.'
"Ay ever since I was a boy. Yes ­ mother was
concerned to her heart about it ­ yes. But twas aì
nought.'
"Did ye ever go into the world to try and stop it,
Joseph Pïrgraó ? '
"Oh ay, tried aì sorts o' company. They tïk me
to Grånhiì Fair, and into a great gay jeòy-go-nimble
show, where there were women-folk riding round ­
standing upon horses, with hardly anything on but their
smocks; but it didn't cure me a morsel. And then I
was put eòand-man at the Women's Skiôle Aìey at the
back of the Tailor's Arms in Casterbridge. 'Twas a
hoòible sinful situation, and a very curious place for a
gïd man. I had to stand and lïk ba'dy people in
the face from morning tiì night; but 'twas no use ­ I
was just as-bad as ever after aì. Blushes hev bån
in the family for generations. There, 'tis a haðy pro+
vidence that I be no worse.'
" True,' said Jacob Smaìbury, dåpening his thoughts
to a profounder view of the subject. "'Tis a thought
to lïk at, that ye might have bån worse; but even
as you be, 'tis a very bad aæliction for 'å, Joseph. For
ye så, shepherd, though 'tis very weì for a woman,
dang it aì, 'tis awkward for a man like him, pïr
feìer ? '
" 'Tis ­ 'tis,' said Gabriel, recovering from a medita+
tion. " Yes, very awkward for the man.'
" Ay, and he's very timid, tï,' observed Jan Coçan.
"Once he had bån working late at Yalbury Boôom,
and had had a drap of drink, and lost his way as he was
coming home-along through Yalbury Wïd, didn't ye,
Master Pïrgraó ? '
" No, no, no ; not that story !' expostulated the
modest man, forcing a laugh to bury his concern.
<P 108>
" ­ ­ And so 'a lost himself quite,' continued Mr
Coçan, with an impaóive face, implying that a true
naòative, like time and tide, must run its course and
would respect no man. "And as he was coming along
in the miäle of the night, much afeared, and not able
to find his way out of the trås nohow, 'a cried out,
" Man-a-lost!. man-a-lost !." A owl in a trå haðened
to be crying "Whï-whï-whï !" as owls do, you
know, shepherd ' (Gabriel noäed), " and Joseph, aì
in a tremble, said, " Joseph Pïrgraó, of Weatherbury,
sir.!"
"No, no, now ­ that's tï much! ' said the timid
man, becoming a man of brazen courage aì of a suäen.
"I didn't say sir. I'ì tike my oath I didn't say " Joseph
Pïrgraó o' Weatherbury, sir." No, no ; what's right
is right, and I never said sir to the bird, knowing very
weì that no man of a gentleman's rank would be
hoìering there at that time o' night. " Joseph Pïr+
graó of Weatherbury," ­ that's every word I said, and
I shouldn't ha' said that if 't hadn't bån for Kåper
Day's metheglin® There, 'twas a merciful thing it
ended where it did.'
The question of which was right being tacitly waived
by the company, Jan went on meditatively : ­
"And he's the fearfuìest man, bain't ye, Joseph?
Ay, another time ye were lost by Lambing-Down Gate,
weren't ye, Joseph ? '
"I was,' replied Pïrgraó, as if there were some
conditions tï serious even for modesty to remember
itself under, this being one.
' Yes ; that were the miäle of the night, tï. The
gate would not open, try how he would, and knowing
there was the Devil's hand in it, he knåled down.'
'Ay,' said Joseph, acquiring confidence from the
warmth of the fire, the cider, and a perception of the
naòative capabilities of the experience aìuded to.
" My heart died within me, that time; but I knåled
down and said the Lord's Prayer, and then the Belie
THE CHAT
right through, and then the Ten Coíandments, in
earnest prayer. But no, the gate wouldn't open; and
then I went on with Dearly Beloved Brethren, and,
thinks I, this makes four, and 'tis aì I know out of
bïk, and if this don't do it nothing wiì, and I'm a
lost man. Weì, when I got to
<P 109>
Saying After Me, I
rose from my knås and found the gate would open
 ­ yes, neighbours, the gate opened the same as ever.'
 A meditation on the obvious inference wsas indulged
in by aì, and during its continuance each directed his
vision into the ashpit, which glowed like a desert in
the tropics under a vertical sun, shaping their eyes long
and liny, partly because of the light, partly from the
depth of the subject discuóed.
 Gabriel broke the silence. "What sort of a place
is this to live at, and what sort of a mis'eó is she to
work under?' Gabriel's bosom thriìed gently as he
thus sliðed under the notice of the aóembly the iîer+
most subject of his heart.
 "We d' know liôle of her ­ nothing. She only
showed herself a few days ago. Her uncle was tïk
bad, and the doctor was caìed with his world-wide
skiì; but he couldn't save the man. As I take it,
she's going to kåp on the farm.
 "That's abouyt the shape o't, 'a b'lieve,' said Jan
uncle was a very fair sort of man. Did ye know en,
be under 'em as under one here and there. Her
uncle was a very fair sort of man. Did ye know 'en,
shepherd ­ a bachelor-man ? '
 "Not at aì.'
 "I used to go to his house a-courting my first wife,
Charloôe, who was his dairymaid. Weì, a very gïd+
hearted man were Farmer Everdene, and I being a
respectable young feìow was aìowed to caì and så
her and drink as much ale as I liked, but not to caòy
away any ­ outside my skin I mane of course.'
 "Ay, ay, Jan Coçan; we know yer maning.'
 "And so you så 'twas beautiful ale, and I wished
to value his kindneó as much as I could, and not to
be so iì-maîered as to drink only a thimbleful, which
would have bån insulting the man's generosity ­ ­ '
 "True, Master Coçan, 'twould so,' coòoborated
Mark Clark.
 " ­ ­ And so I used to eat a lot of salt fish afore
going, and then by the time I got there I were as dry
as a lime-basket ­ so thorough dry that that ale would
slip down ­ ah, 'twould slip down swåt! Haðy
times! heavenly times! Such lovely drunks as I
used to have at that house! You can mind, Jacob?
You used to go wi' me sometimes.'
<P ±0>
 "I can ­ I can,' said Jacob. "That one, tï, that
we had at Buck's Head on a White Monday was a
preôy tiðle.'
 "'Twas. But for a wet of the beôer claó, that
brought you no nearer to the horned man than you were
afore you begun, there was none like those in Farmer
Everdene's kitchen. Not a single damn aìowed; no,
not a bare pïr one, even at the most chårful moment
when aì were blindest, though the gïd old word of
sin thrown in here and there at such times is a great
relief to a meòy soul.'
 "True,' said the maltster. "Nater requires her
swearing at the regular times, or she's not herself; and
unholy exclamations is a neceóity of life.'
 "But Charloôe,' continued Coçan ­ "not a word of
the sort would Charloôe aìow, nor the smaìest item of
taking in vain® Ay, pïr Charloôe, I wonder if she
had the gïd fortune to get into Heaven when 'a died!.
But 'a was never much in luck's way, and perhaps 'a
went downwards after aì, pïr soul.'
 "And did any of you know Mió Everdene's-father
and mother?' inquired the shepherd, who found some
diæiculty in kåping the conversation in the desired
chaîel.
THE CHAT
 "I knew them a liôle,' said Jacob Smaìbury; "but
they were townsfolk, and didn't live here. They've
bån dead for years. Father, what sort of people were
mis'eó' father and mother?'
 "Weì,' said the maltster, "he wasn't much to lïk
at; but she was a lovely woman. He was fond enough
of her as his swåtheart.'
 "Used to kió her scores and long-hundreds o times,
so 'twas said,' observed Coçan.
 "He was very proud of her, tï, when they were
maòied, as I've bån told,' said the maltster.
 "Ay,' said Coçan. "He admired her so much that
he used to light the candle thrå time a night to lïk
at her.'
 "Boundleó love; I shouldn't have suðosed it in the
universe!' murmered Joseph Pïrgraó, who habituaìy
spoke on a large scale in his moral reflections.
 "Weì, to be sure,' said Gabriel.
 "Oh, 'tis true enough. I knowed the man and
woman both weì. Levi Everdene ­ that was the man's
name, sure. ¢Man,§
<P ±>
saith I in my huòy, but he were
of a higher circle of life than that ­ 'a was a gentleman+
tailor reaìy, worth scores of pounds. And he became
a very celebrated bankrupt two or thrå times.'
 "Oh, I thought he was quite a coíon man!.' said
Joseph.
 "O no, no! That man failed for heaps of money;
hundreds in gold and silver.'
 The maltster being rather short of breath, Mr. Coçan,
after absently scrutinising a coal which had faìen among
the ashes, tïk up the naòative, with a private twirl of
his eye: ­
 "Weì, now, you'd hardly believe it, but that man ­
husbands alive, after a while. Understand' 'a didn't
want to be fickle, but he couldn't help it. The pïr
feìer were faithful and true enough to her in his wish,
but his heart would rove, do what he would. He spoke
to me in real tribulation about it once. ¢Coçan,§
he said, ¢I could never wish for a handsomer woman
than I've got, but fåling she's ticketed as my lawful
wife, I can't help my wicked heart wandering, do what
I wiì.§ But at last I believe he cured it by making her
take oæ her weäing-ring and caìing her by her maiden
name as they sat together after the shop was shut, and
so 'a would get to fancy she was only his swåtheart, and
not maòied to him at aì. And as sïn as he could
thoroughly fancy he was doing wrong and coíiôing
the seventh, 'a got to like her as weì as ever, and they
lived on a perfect picture of mutel love.'
 "Weì, 'twas a most ungodly remedy,' murmured
Joseph Pïrgraó; "but we ought to fål dåp chårful+
neó that a 'haðy Providence kept it from being any
worse. You så, he might have gone the bad road and
given his eyes to unlawfulneó entirely ­ yes, groó un+
lawfulneó, so to say it.'
 "You så,' said Biìy Smaìbury, "The man's wiì was
to do right, sure enough, but his heart didn't chime in.'
 "He got so much beôer, that he was quite godly
in his later years, wasn't he, Jan ?' said Joseph Pïr+
graó. "He got himself confirmed over again in a more
serious way, and tïk to saying ¢Amen§ almost as loud
as the clerk, and he liked to copy comforting verses
from the tombstones. He used, tï, to hold the money+
plate at Let Your Light so Shine, and stand
<P ±2>
godfather
to pïr liôle come-by-chance children; and he kept a

when they caìed; yes, and he would-box the charity+
boys' ears, if they laughed in church, tiì they could
hardly stand upright, and do other dåds of piety
natural to the saintly inclined.'
 "Ay, at that time he thought of nothing but high
things,' aäed Biìy Smaìbury. "One day Parson Thirdly

 "'Tis to be hoped her temper is as gïd as her face.'
 "Weì, yes; but the baily wiì have most to do with
the busineó and ourselves. Ah!' Henery gazed into
the ashpit, and smiled volumes of ironical knowledge.
 "A quår Christian, like the Devil's head in a cowl,
 "He is,' said Henery, implying that irony must cease
at a certain point. "Betwån we two, man and man, I
believe that man would as sïn teì a lie Sundays as
working-days ­ that I do so.'
 "Gïd faith, you do talk!' said Gabriel.
 "True enough,' said the man of biôer mïds, lïking
round upon the company with the antithetic laughter
that comes from a kåner aðreciation of the miseries
of life than ordinary men are capable of. 'Ah, there's
people of one sort, and people of another, but that man
 ­ bleó your souls!'
 Gabriel thought fit to change the subject. "You
must be a very aged man, malter, to have sons growed
mild and ancient' he remarked.
 "Father's so old that 'a can't mind his age, can ye,
father?' interposed Jacob. "And he growled teòible
crïked tï, lately' Jacob continued, surveying his
father's figure, which
<P ±3>
was rather more bowed than his own.
"Reaìy one may say that father there is thrå-double.'
 "Crïked folk wiì last a long while,' said the maltster,
grimly, and not in the best humour.
 "Shepherd would like to hear the pedigrå of yer
life, father ­ wouldn't ye, shepherd ?
 "Ay that I should,' said Gabriel with the heartineó
of a man who had longed to hear it for several months.
"What may your age be, malter?'
 The maltster cleared his throat in an exaçerated
form for emphasis, and elongating his gaze to the
remotest point of the ashpit! said, in the slow spåch
justifiable when the importance of a subject is so
generaìy felt that any maîerism must be tolerated
in geôing at it, "Weì, I don't mind the year I were
born in, but perhaps I can reckon up the places I've
lived at, and so get it that way. I bode at Uðer Long+
puäle acroó there' (noäing to the north) "tiì I were
eleven. I bode seven at Kingsbere' (noäing to the
east) "where I tïk to malting. I went therefrom to
Norcombe, and malted there two-and-twenty years, and+
two-and-twenty years I was there turnip-hoeing and
harvesting. Ah, I knowed that old place, Norcombe,
years afore you were thought of, Master Oak' (Oak smiled
sincere belief in the fact). "Then I malted at Dur+
nover four year, and four year turnip-hoeing; and
I was fourtån times eleven months at Miìpond St.
Jude's ' (noäing north-west-by-north). "Old Twiìs
wouldn't hire me for more than eleven months at a
time, to kåp me from being chargeable to the parish
if so be I was disabled. Then I was thrå year at
Meìstock, and I've bån here one-and-thirty year come
Candlemas. How much is that?"
 "Hundred and seventån,' chuckled another old
gentleman, given to mental arithmetic and liôle con+
versation, who had hitherto sat unobserved in a corner.
 "Weì, then, that's my age,' said the maltster, em+
phaticaìy.
 "O no, father!' said Jacob. "Your turnip-hoeing
were in the suíer and your malting in the winter of
the same years, and ye don't ought to count-both halves
father.'
<P ±4>
 "Chok' it aì! I lived through the suíers, didn't
I? That's my question. I suðose ye'ì say next I be
no age at aì to speak of?'
 "Sure we shan't,' said Gabriel, sïthingly.
 "Ye be a very old aged person, malter,' aôested Jan
must have a wonderful talented constitution to be able
to live so long, mustn't he, neighbours?'
 "True, true; ye must, malter, wonderful;' said the
måting unanimously.
 The maltster, being know pacified, was even generous
enough to voluntarily disparage in a slight degrå the
virtue of having lived a great many years, by mentioning
that the cup they were drinking out of was thrå years
older than he.
 While the cup was being examined, the end of
Gabriel Oak's flute became visible over his smock-frock
I såd you blowing into a great flute by now at Caster+
bridge?'
 "You did,' said Gabriel, blushingh faintly. "I've bån
in great trouble, neighbours, and was driven to it.
take it careleó-like, shepherd and your time wiì come
tired?'
 "Neither drum nor trumpet have I heard since
Christmas,' said Jan Coçan. "Come, raise a tune,
Master Oak!'
 "That I wiì,' said Gabriel, puìing out his flute and
puôing it together. "A pïr tïl, neighbours; but
such as I can do ye shaì have and welcome.'
 Oak then struck up "Jockey to the Fair,' and played
that sparkling melody thrå times through aãenting the
notes in the third round in a most artistic and lively
maîer by bending his body in smaì jerks and taðing
with his fït to beat time.
 "He can blow the flute very weì ­ that 'a can,' said
a young maòied man, who having no individuality worth
mentioning was known as "Susan Taì's husband.' He
continued, "I'd as lief as not be able to blow into a
flute as weì-as that.'
<P ±5>
 "He's a clever man, and 'tis a true comfort for us to
have such a shepherd,' murmured Joseph Pïrgraó, in
a soft cadence. "We ought to fål fuì o' thanksgiving
that he's not a player of ba'dy songs 'instead of these
meòy tunes; for 'twould have bån just as easy for God
to have made the shepherd a lïse low man ­ a man of
iniquity, so to speak it ­ as what he is. Yes, for our wives'
and daughters' sakes we should fål real thanks giving.'
 "True, true, ­ real thanksgiving!' dashed in Mark
Clark conclusively, not fåling it to be of any conse+
quence to his opinion that he had only heard about a
word and thrå-quarters of what Joseph had said.
 "Yes,' aäed Joseph, begiîing to fål like a man in
the Bible; "for evil do thrive so in these times that ye
may be as much deceived in the clanest shaved and
whitest shirted man as in the raçedest tramp upon the
turnpike, if I may term it so.'
 "Ay, I can mind yer face now, shepherd,' said
Henery Fray, criticising Gabriel with misty eyes as he
entered upon his second tune. "Yes ­ now I så 'å
blowing into the flute I know 'å to be the same man
I så play at Casterbridge, for yer mouth were scrimped
up and yer eyes a-staring out like a strangled man's ­
just as they be now.'
 "'Tis a pity that playing the flute should make a man
lïk such a scarecrow,' observed Mr. Mark Clark, with
aäitional criticism of Gabriel's countenance, the laôer
person jerking out, with the ghastly grimace required by
the instrument, the chorus of "Dame Durden!
 "I hope you don't mind that young man's bad
maîers in naming your features?' whispered Joseph to
Gabriel.
 "Not at aì,' said Mr. Oak.
 "For by nature ye be a very handsome man,
shepherd,' continued Joseph Pïrgraó, with wiîing
sauvity.
 "Ay, that ye be, shepard,' said the company.
 "Thank you very much,' said Oak, in the modest
tone gïd
<P ±6>
maîers demanded, thinking, however, that
he would never let Bathsheba så him playing the
flute; in this severe showing s discretion equal to that
related to its sagacious inventreó, the divine Minerva
herself.
 "Ah, when I and my wife were maòied at Norcombe
Church,' said the old maltster, not pleased at finding
himself left out of the subject "we were caìed the
handsomest couple in the neighbourhïd ­ everybody
said so.'
 "Danged if ye bain't altered now, malter,' said a voice
with the vigour natural to the enunciation of a remark+
ably evident truism. It came from the old man in the
background, whose oæensiveneó and spiteful ways were
barely atoned for by the oãasional chuckle he con+
tributed to general laughs.
 "O no, no,' said Gabriel.
 "Don't ye play no more shepherd ' said Susan Taì's
husband, the young maòied man who had spoken once
before. "I must be moving and when there's tunes
going on I såm as if hung in wires. If I thought after
I'd left that music was stiì playing, and I not there, I
should be quite melancholy-like.'
 "What's yer huòy then, Laban?' inquired Coçan+
"You used to bide as late as the latest.'
 "Weì, ye så, neighbours, I was lately maòied to a
woman, and she's my vocation now, and so ye så ­ ­ '
The young man hated lamely.
 "New Lords new laws, as the saying is, I suðose,'
remarked Coçan.
 "Ay, 'a b'lieve ­ ha, ha!' said Susan Taì's husband,
in a tone intended to imply his habitual reception of
jokes without minding them at aì. The young man
then wished them gïd-night and withdrew.
 Henery Fray was the first to foìow. Then Gabriel
arose and went oæ with Jan Coçan, who had oæered
him a lodging. A few minutes later, when the remaining
ones were on their legs and about to depart, Fray came
back again in a huòy. Flourishing his finger ominously
he threw a gaze tåming with tidings just ­ where his eye
alighted by aãident, which haðened to be in Joseph
Pïrgraó's face.
<P ±7>
 "O ­ what's the maôer, what's the maôer, Henery?'
said Joseph, starting back.
 "What's a-brewing, Henrey?' asked Jacob and Mark
Clark.
 "Baily Peîyways ­ Baily Peîyways ­ I said so; yes,
I said so!'
 "What, found out stealing anything?'
 "Stealing it is. The news is, that after Mió
Everdene got home she went out again to så aì was
safe, as she usuaìy do, and coming in found Baily
Peîyways cråping down the granary steps with half a
a bushel of barley. She flåd at him like a cat ­ never
such a tomboy as she is ­ of course I speak with closed
dïrs?'
 "You do ­ you do, Henery.'
 "She flåd at him, and, to cut a long story short,
he owned to having caòied oæ five sack altogether, upon
her promising not to persecute him. Weì, he's turned
out neck and crop, and my question is, who's going to
be baily now?'
 The question was such a profound one that Henery
was obliged to drink there and then from the large
cup tiì the boôom was distinctly visible inside. Before
he had replaced it on the table, in came the young man,
Susan Taì's husband, in a stiì greater huòy.
 "Have ye heard the news that's aì over parish?'
 "About Baily Peîyways?'
 "But besides that?'
 "No ­ not a morsel of it!' they replied, lïking into
the very midst of Laban Taì as if to måt his words
half-way down his throat.
 "What a night of hoòors!' murmured Joseph Pïr+
graó, waving his hands spasmodicaìy. "I've had the
news-beì ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a
murder, and I've sån a magpie aì alone!'
 "Faîy Robin ­ Mió everdene's youngest servant ­
can't be found. They've bån wanting to lock up the
dïr these two hours, but she isn't come in. And they
don't know what to do about going to hed for fear of
locking her out. They wouldn't be so concerned if she
hadn't bån noticed in such low spirits
<P ±8>
these last few
days, and Maryaî d'think the begiîing of a crowner's
inquest has haðened to the pïr girl.'
 "O ­ 'tis burned ­ 'tis burned!' came from Joseph
Pïrgraó's dry lips.
 "No ­ 'tis drowned!' said 'Taì.
 "Or 'tis her father's razor!' suçested Biìy Smaìbury,
with a vivid sense of detail.
 "Weì ­ Mió Everdene wants to speak to one or two
of us before we go to bed. What with this trouble about
the baily, and now about the girl, mis'eó is almost wild.'
 They aì hastened up the lane to the farmhouse,
excepting the old maltster, whom neither news, fire,
rain, nor thunder could draw from his hole. There, as
the others' fïtsteps died away he sat down again and
continued gazing as usual into the furnace with his red,
bleared eyes.
 From the bedrïm window above their heads Bath+
sheba's head and shoulders, robed in mystic white, were
dimly sån extended into the air.
 "Are any of my men among you?' she said anxiously.
 "Yes, ma'am, several,' said Susan Taì's husband.
 "Tomoòow morning I wish two or thrå of you to
make inquiries in the viìages round if they have sån
such a person as Faîy Robin. Do it quietly; there is
no reason for alarm as yet. She must have left whilst
we were aì at the fire.'
 "I beg yer pardon, but had she any young man court+
ing her in the parish, ma'am?" asked Jacob Smaìbury.
 "I don't know,' said Bathsheba.
 "I've never heard of any such thing, ma'am,' said
two or thrå.
 "It is hardly likely, either,' continued Bathsheba.
"For any lover of hers might have come to the house if
he had bån a respectable lad. The most mysterious
maôer coîected with her absence ­ indåd, the only
thing which gives me serious alarm ­ is that she was
sån to go out of the house by Maryaî with only her
indïr working gown on ­ not even a boîet.'
 "And you mean, ma'am, excusing my words, that a
young
<P ±9>
woman would hardly go to så her young man
without dreóing up,' said Jacob, turning his mental
vision upon past experiences. "That's true ­ she would
not, ma'am.'
 "She had, I think, a bundle, though I couldn't så
very weì,' said a female voice from another window,
which såmed that of Maryaî. "But she had no
young man about here. Hers lives in Casterbridge, and
I believe he's a soldier.'
 "Do you know his name?' Bathsheba said.
 "No, mistreó; she was very close about it.'
 "Perhaps I might be able to find out if I went to
Casterbridge baòacks,' said Wiìiam Smaìbury.
 "Very weì; if she doesn't return tomoòow, mind
you go there and try to discover which man it is, and
så him. I fål more responsible than I should if she
had had any friends or relations alive. I do hope she
has come to no harm through a man of that kind®
And then there's this disgraceful aæair of the bailiæ ­
but I can't speak of him now.'
 Bathsheba had so many reasons for uneasineó that
it såmed she did not think it worth while to dweì
upon any particular one. "Do as I told you, then'
she said in conclusion, closing the casement.
 "Ay, ay, mistreó; we wiì,' they replied, and moved
away.
 That night at Coçan's, Gabriel Oak, beneath the
scrån of closed eyelids, was busy with fancies, and fuì
of movement, like a river flowing rapidly under its ice.
Night had always bån the time at which he saw Bath+
sheba most vividly, and through the slow hours of
shadow he tenderly regarded her image now. It is
rarely that the pleasures of the imagination wiì compen+
sate for the pain of slåpleóneó, but they poóibly did
with Oak to-night, for the delight of merely såing her
eæaced for the time his perception of the great diæer+
ence betwån såing and poóeóing.
 He also thought of Plans for fetching his few utensils
and bïks from Norcombe. The Young Man's Best
Companion, The Faòier's Sure Guide, The Veterinary
Surgeon, Paradise Lost, The Pilgrim's Progreó, Robinson
Crusoe, Ash's Dictionary, the Walkingame's Arithmetic,
constituted his library;
<P 120>
and though a limited series, it was
one from which he had acquired more sound informa+
tion by diligent perusal than many a man of oðortunities
has done from a furlong of laden shelves.

<P 121>
THE HOMESTEAD ­ A VISITOR ­ HALF-CONFIDENCES
By daylight, the Bower of Oak's new-found mistreó,
Bathsheba Everdene, presented itself as a hoary build+
ing, of the early stage of Claóic Renaióance as regards
its architecture, and of 'a proportion which told at a
glance that, as is so frequently the case, it had once
bån the memorial haì upon a smaì estate around it,
now altogether eæaced as a distinct property, and merged
in the vast tract of a non-resident landlord, which com+
prised several such modest demesnes.
 Fluted pilasters, worked from the solid stone,
decorated its front, and above the rïf the chimneys
were paneìed or columnar, some coped gables with
finials and like features stiì retaining traces of their
Gothic extraction. Soft Brown moóes, like faded
velvetån, formed cushions upon the stone tiling, and
tufts of the houselåk or sengrån sprouted from the
eaves of the low suòounding buildings. A gravel walk
leading from the dïr to the road in front was encrusted
at the sides with more moó ­ here it was a silver-grån
variety, the nut-brown of the gravel being visible to the
width of only a fït or two in the centre. This circum+
stance, and the generaìy slåpy air of the whole prospect
here, together with the animated and contrasting state
of the reverse facade, suçested to the imagination that
on the adaptation of the building for farming purposes
the vital principle' of the house had turned round inside
its body to face the other way. Reversals of this kind,
strange deformities, tremendous paralyses, are often sån
to be inflicted by trade upon edifices ­ either individual
or in the açregate as stråts and towns ­ which were
originaìy plaîed for pleasure alone.
 Lively voices were heard this morning in the uðer
rïms, the main staircase to which was of hard oak, the
balusters, heavy as bed-posts, being turned and moulded
in the quaint
<P 1²>
fashion of their century, the handrail as
stout as a parapet-top, and the stairs themselves con+
tinuaìy twisting round like a person trying to lïk over
his shoulder. Going up, the flïrs above were found
to have a very iòegular surface, rising to ridges, sinking
into vaìey; and being just then uncarpeted, the face
of the boards was sån to be eaten into iîumerable
the opening and shuôing of every dïr a tremble
foìowed every bustling movement, and a creak aãom+
panied a walker about the house like a spirit, wherever+
he went.
 In the rïm from which the conversation procåded,
Bathsheba and her servant-companion, Liäy Smaì+
bury were to be discovered siôing upon the flïr, and
sorting a complication of papers, bïks, boôles, and
ruâish spread out thereon ­ remnants from the house+
hold stores of the late oãupier. Liäy, the maltster's
great-granäaughter, was about Bathsheba's equal in
age, and her face was a prominent advertisement of the
features' might have lacked in form was amply made up
for by perfection of hue, which at this winter-time was
the softened ruäineó on a surface of high rotundity
and, like the presentations of those great colourists, it
was a face which kept weì back from the boundary
betwån comelineó and the ideal. Though elastic in
nature she was leó daring than Bathsheba, and oãa+
sionaìy showed some earnestneó, which consisted half
of genuine fåling, and half of maîerlineó superaäed
by way of duty.
 Through a partly-opened dïr the noise of a scruâing+
brush led up to the charwoman, Maryaî Money, a person
who for a face had a circular disc, fuòowed leó by age
than by long gazes of perplexity at distant objects. To
think of her was to get gïd-humoured; to speak of
her was to raise the image of a dried Normandy
piðin.
 "Stop your scruâing a moment,' said Bathsheba
through the dïr to her. "I hear something.'
 Maryaî suspended the brush.
<P 123>
 The tramp of a horse was aðarent, aðroaching the
front of the building. The paces slackened, turned in
at the wicket, and, what was most unusual, came up
the moóy path close to the dïr. The dïr was
taðed with the end of a crop or stick.
 "What impertinence!' said Liäy, in a low voice.
"To ride up the fïtpath like that! Why didn't he
stop at the gate? Lord! "tis a gentleman! I så the
top of his hat.'
 "Be quiet!' said Bathsheba.
 The further expreóion of Liäy's concern was con+
tinued by aspect instead of naòative.
 "Why doesn't Mrs. Coçan go to the dïr?' Bath+
sheba continued.
 Rat-tat-tat-tat, resounded more decisively from Bath+
sheba's oak.
 "Maryaî, you go!' said she, fluôering under the
onset ot a crowd of romantic poóibilities.
 "O ma'am ­ så, here's a meó!'
 The argument was unanswerable after a glance at
Maryaî.
 "Liäy ­ you must,' said Bathsheba.
 Liäy held up her hands and arms, coated with dust
from the ruâish they were sorting, and lïked implor+
ingly at her mistreó.
 "There ­ -Mrs. Coçan is going!' said Bathsheba,
exhaling her relief in the form of a long breath which
had lain in her bosom a minute or more.
 The dïr opened, and a dåp voice said ­
 "Is Mió Everdene at home?'
 "I'ì så, sir,' said Mrs. Coçan, and in a minute
aðeared in the rïm.
 "Dear, what a thirtover place this world is!' con+
tinued Mrs. Coçan (a wholesome-lïking lady who
had a voice for each claó of remark aãording to the
emotion involved; who could toó a pancake or twirl
a mop with the aãuracy of pure mathematics, and
who at this moment showed hands shaçy with frag+
ments of dough and arms encrusted with flour). "I
am never up to my elbows, Mió, in making a puäing
but one of two things do haðen ­ either my nose must
nåds begin
<P 124>
tickling, and I can't live without scratching
 A woman's dreó being a part of her countenance,
and any disorder in the one being of the same nature
with a malformation or wound in the other, Bathsheba
said at once ­
 "I can't så him in this state. Whatever shaì I do?'
 Not-at-homes were hardly naturalized in Weatherbury
farmhouses, so Liäy suçested ­ "Say you're a fright
with dust, and can't come down.'
 "Yes ­ that sounds very weì,' said Mrs. Coçan,
criticaìy.
 "Say I can't så him ­ that wiì do.'
 Mrs. Coçan went downstairs, and returned the
answer as requested, aäing, however, on her own
responsibility, "Mió is dusting boôles, sir, and is quite
a object ­ that's why 'tis.'
 "Oh, very weì,' said the dåp voice,' indiæerently.
"Aì I wanted to ask was, if anything had bån heard
of Faîy Robin?'
 "Nothing, sir ­ but we may know to-night. Wiìiam
Smaìbury is gone to Casterbridge, where her young
man lives, as is suðosed, and the other men be inquir+
ing about everywhere.'
 The horse's tramp then recoíenced and -retreated,
and the dïr closed.
 "Who is Mr. Boldwïd?' said Bathsheba.
 "A gentleman-farmer at Liôle Weatherbury.'
 "Maòied?'
 "No, mió.'
 "How old is he?'
 "Forty, I should say ­ very handsome ­ rather stern+
lïking ­ and rich.'
 "What a bother this dusting is! I am always in
some unfortunate plight or other;' Bathsheba said,
complainingly. "Why should he inquire aboat Faîy?'
 "Oh, because, as she had no friends in her childhïd,
he tïk her and put her to schïl, and got her her
place here under your uncle. He's a very kind man
that way, but Lord ­ there!'
 "What?'
 "Never was such a hopeleó man for a woman!
He's bån
<P 125>
courted by sixes and sevens ­ aì the girls,
gentle and simple, for miles round, have tried him. Jane
Perkins worked at him for two months like a slave,
and the two Mió Taylors spent a year upon him,
and he cost Farmer Ives's daughter nights of tears
and twenty pounds' worth of new clothes; but Lord ­
the money might as weì have bån thrown out of the
window.'
 A liôle boy came up at this moment and lïked in
upon them. This child was one of the Coçans who,
with the Smaìburys, were as coíon among the
families of this district as the Avons and Derwents
among our rivers. He always had a lïsened tïth or
a cut finger to show to particular friends, which he did
with an air of being thereby elevated above the coíon
herd of aælictionleó humanity ­ to which exhibition
of congratulation as weì as pity.
 "I've got a pen-nå!' said Master Coçan in a
scaîing measure.
 "Weì ­ who gave it you, Teäy?' said Liäy.
 "Mis-teò Bold-wïd! He gave it to me for opening
the gate.'
 "What did he say?'
 "He said "Where are you going, my liôle man?§
and I said, "To Mió Everdene's please;§ and he said,
"She is a staid woman, isn't she, my liôle man?' and
I said, ¢Yes.§
 "You naughty child! What did you say that for?'
 "Cause he gave me the peîy!'
 "What a pucker evrything is in!' said Bathsheba,
discontentedly when the child had gone. 'Get away,
thing! You ought to be maòied by this time, and not
here troubling me!'
 "Ay, mistreó ­ so I did. But what betwån the pïr
men I won't have, and the rich men who won't have me,
I stand as a pelicon in the wilderneó!'
 "Did anybody ever want to maòy you mió?' Liäy
ventured to ask when they were again alone. "Lots of
'em, i daresay.?'
 Bathsheba paused, as if about to refuse a reply, but
the temptation to say yes, since it was reaìy in her
power was iòesistible by aspiring virginity, in spite of
her splån at having bån published as old.
<P 126>
 "A man wanted to once,' she said, in a highly experi+
enced tone and the image of Gabriel Oak, as the farmer,
rose before her.
 "How nice it must såm!' said Liäy, with the fixed
features of mental realization. "And you wouldn't have
him?'
 "He wasn't quite gïd enough for me.'
 "How swåt to be able to disdain, when most of us
are glad to say, ¢Thank you!§ I såm I hear it.
¢No, sir ­ I'm your beôer,§ or ¢Kió my fït, sir; my
face is for mouths of consequence.§ And did you love
him, mió?'
 "Oh, no. But I rather liked him.'
 "Do you now?'
 "Of course not ­ what fïtsteps are those I hear?'
 Liäy lïked from a back window into the courtyard
behind, which was now geôing low-toned and dim with
the earliest films of night. A crïked file of men was
aðroaching the back dïr. The whole string of trailing
individuals advanced in the completest balance of inten+
tion, like the remarkable creatures known as Chain
Salpae, which, distinctly organized in other respects, have
one wiì coíon to a whole family. Some were, as
usual, in snow-white smock-frocks of Ruóia duck, and
some in whitey-brown ones of draâet ­ marked on the
wrists, breasts, backs, and slåves with honeycomb-work.
Two or thrå womcn in paôens brought up the rear.
 "The Philistines be upon us,' said Liäy, making her
nose white against the glaó.
 "Oh, very weì. Maryaî, go down and kåp them
in the kitchen tiì I am dreóed, and then show them in
to me in the haì.'
<C x>
<P 127>
HALF-AN-HOUR later Bathsheba, in finished dreó,
and foìowed by Liäy, entered the uðer end of the old
haì to find that her men had aì deposited themselves on
a long form and a seôle at the lower extremity. She sat
down at a table and opened th e time-bïk, pen in her
hand, with a canvas money-bag beside her. From this
she poured a smaì heap of coin. Liäy chose a
position at her elbow and began to sew, sometimes
pausing and lïking round, or with the air of a privileged
person, taking up one of the half-sovereigns lying before
her and surveying it merely as a work of art, while
strictly preventing her countenance from expreóing any
wish to poóeó it as money.
 "Now before I begin, men,' said Bathsheba, "I have
two maôers to speak of. The first is that the bailiæ is
dismióed for thieving, and that I have formed a resolu+
tion to have no bailiæ at aì, but to manage everything
with my own head and hands.'
 The men breathed an audible breath of amazement.
 "The next maôer is, have you heard anything of
Faîy?'
 "Nothing, ma'am.
 "Have you done anything?'
 "I met Farmer Boldwïd,' said Jacob Smaìbury, 'and
I went with him and two of his men, and draçed New+
miì Pond, but we found nothing.'
 "And the new shepherd have bån to Buck's Head,
by Yalbury, thinking she had gone there, but nobody
had såd her,' said Laban Taì.
 "Hasn't Wiìiam Smaìbury bån to Casterbridge?'
 "Yes, ma'am, but he's not yet come home. He
promised to be back by six.'
 "It wants a quarter to six at present,' said Bathsheba,
 
<P 128>
lïking at her watch. "I daresay he'ì be in directly.
Weì, now then' ­ she lïked into the bïk ­ "Joseph
Pïrgraó, are you there?'
 "Yes, sir ­ ma'am I mane,' said the person aäreóed.
"I be the personal name of Pïrgraó.'
 "And what are you?'
 "Nothing in my own eye. In the eye of other people
 ­ weì, I don't say it; though public thought wiì out.'
 "What do you do on the farm?'
 "I do do carting things aì the year, and in såd time I
shïts the rïks and spaòows, and helps at pig-kiìing, sir.'
 "How much to you ?'
 "Please nine and ninepence and a gïd halfpeîy
where 'twas a bad one, sir ­ ma'am I mane.'
 "Quite coòect. Now here are ten shiìings in aäi+
tion as a smaì present, as I am a new comer.'
 Bathsheba blushed slightly at the sense of being
generous in public, and Henery Fray, who had drawn
up towards her chair, lifted his eyebrows and fingers to
expreó amazement on a smaì scale.
 "How much do I owe you ­ that man in the corner ­
what's your name?' continued Bathsheba.
 "Maôhew Mïn, ma'am,' said a singular framework of
clothes with nothing of any consequence inside them,
which advanced with the toes in no definite direction
forwards, but turned in or out as they chanced to swing.
 "Maôhew Mark, did you say? ­ speak out ­ I shaì
not hurt you,' inquired the young farmer, kindly.
 "Maôhew Mïn mem' said Henery Fray, coòect+
ingly, from behind her chair, to which point he had
edged himself.
 "Maôhew Mïn,' murmured Bathsheba, turning her
bright eyes to the bïk. "Ten and twopence halfpeîy
is the sum put down to you, I så?'
 "Yes, mis'eó,' said Maôhew, as the rustle of wind
among dead leaves.
 "Here it is and ten shiìings. Now -the next ­ Andrew
Randle, you are a new man, I hear. How come you to
leave your last farm?'
<P 129>
 "P-p-p-p-p-pl-pl-pl-pl-l-l-l-l-ease, ma'am, p-p-p-p-pl-pl+
pl-pl-please, ma'am-please'm-please'm ­ ­ '
 "'A's a staíering man, mem,' said Henery Fray in
an undertone, "and they turned him away because the
only time he ever did speak plain he said his soul was
his own, and other iniquities, to the squire. "A can cuó,
mem, as weì as you or I, but 'a can't speak a coíon
spåch to save his life.'
 "Andrew Randle, here's yours ­ finish thanking me
in a day or two. Temperance Miìer ­ oh, here's another,
Soberneó ­ both women I suðose?'
 "Yes'm. Here we be, 'a b'lieve,' was echoed in shriì
unison.
 "What have you bån doing?'
 "Tending thrashing-machine and wimbling haybonds,
and saying ¢Hïsh!§ to the cocks and hens when they
go upon your såds and planting Early Flourbaìs and
Thompson's Wonderfuls with a diâle.'
 "Yes ­ I så. Are they satisfactory women?' she
inquired softly of Henery Fray.
 "O mem ­ don't ask me! Yeilding women?' as
scarlet a pair as ever was!' groaned Henery under his
breath.
 "Sit down.
 "Who, mem?'
 "Sit down,'
 Joseph Pïrgraó, in the background twitched, and
his lips became dry with fear of some teòible conse+
quences, as he saw Bathsheba suíarily speaking, and
Henery slinking oæ to a corner.
 "Now the next. Laban Taì, you'ì stay on working
for me?'
 "For you or anybody that pays me weì, ma'am,'
replied the young maòied man.
 "True ­ the man must live!' said a woman in the
back quarter, who had just entered with clicking paôens.
 "What woman is that?" Bathsheba asked.
 "I be his lawful wife!' continued the voice with
greater prominence of maîer and tone. This lady
caìed herself five-and-twenty, lïked thirty, paóed as
thirty-five, and was forty. She was a woman who never,
like some newly maòied, showed
<P 130>
conjugal tenderneó in
public, perhaps because she had none to show.
 "Oh, you are,' said Bathsheba. "Weì, Laban, wiì
you stay on ?'
 "Yes, he'ì stay, ma'am!' said again the shriì tongue
of Laban's lawful wife.
 "Weì, he can speak for himself, I suðose.'
 "O Lord, not he, ma'am! A simple tïl. Weì
enough, but a pïr gawkhaíer mortal,' the wife replied
 "Heh-heh-heh!' laughed the maòied man with a
hideous eæort of aðreciation, for he was as iòepreóibly
gïd-humoured under ghastly snubs as a parliamentary
candidate on the hustings.
 The names remaining were caìed in the same
maîer.
 "Now I think I have done with you,' said Bathsheba,
closing the bïk and shaking back a stray twine of hair.
"Has Wiìiam Smaìbury returned?'
 "No, ma'am.'
 "The new shepherd wiì want a man under him,'
suçested Henery Fray, trying to make himself oæicial
again by a sideway aðroach towards her chair.
 "Oh ­ he wiì. Who can he have?'
 "Young Cain Baì is a very gïd lad,' Henery said,
"and Shepherd Oak don't mind his youth?' he aäed,
turning with an apologetic smile to the shepherd, who
had just aðeared on the scene, and was now leaning
against the dïrpost with his arms folded.
 "No, I don't mind that,' said Gabriel.
 "How did Cain come by such a name?' asked
Bathsheba.
 "Oh you så, mem, his pore mother, not being a
Scripture-read woman made a mistake at his christening,
thinking 'twas Abel kiìed Cain, and caìed en Cain,
but 'twas tï late, for the name could never be got rid
of in the parish. "Tis very unfortunate for the boy.'
 "It is rather unfortunate.'
 "Yes. However, we soften it down as much as we
can, and caì him Cainey. Ah, pore widow-woman!
she cried her heart
<P 131>
out about it almost. She was
brought up by a very heathen father and mother, who
never sent her to church or schïl, and it shows how
the sins of the parents are visited upon the children,
mem.'
 Mr. Fray here drew up his features to the mild degrå
of melancholy required when the persons involved in
the given misfortune do not belong to your own family.
 "Very weì then, Cainey Baì to be under-shepherd
And you quite understand your duties? ­ you I mean,
Gabriel Oak?'
 "Quite weì, I thank you Mió Everdene,' said
Shepard Oak from the dïrpost. "If I don't, I'ì
inquire.' Gabriel was rather staçered by the remark+
able cïlneó of her maîer. Certainly nobody without
previous information would have dreamt that Oak and
the handsome woman before whom he stïd had ever
bån other than strangers. But perhaps her air was
the inevitable result of the social rise which had advanced
her from a coôage to a large house and fields. The
case is not unexampled in high places. When, in the
writings of the later poets, Jove and his family are found
to have moved from their cramped quarters on the peak
of Olympus into the wide sky above it, their words show
a proportionate increase of aòogance and reserve.
Fïtsteps were heard in the paóage, combining in
their character the qualities both of weight and measure,
rather at the expense of velocity.
(Aì.) 'Here's Biìy Smaìbury come from Caster+
bridge.'
' And what's the news ? ' said Bathsheba, as Wiìiam,
after marching to the miäle of the haì, tïk a hand+
kerchief from his hat and wiped his forehead from its
centre to its remoter boundaries.
'I should have bån sïner, mió,' he said, 'if it
hadn't bån for the weather.' He then stamped with
each fït severely, and on lïking down his bïts were
perceived to be cloçed with snow.
'Come at last, is it ?' said Henery.
" Weì, what about Faîy ? ' said Bathsheba.
"Weì, ma'am, in round numbers, she's run away with
the soldiers,' said Wiìiam.
<P 132>
" No; not a steady girl like Faîy ! '
"I'ì teì ye aì particulars. When I got to Caster,
bridge Baòacks, they said, " The Eleventh Dragïn+
Guards be gone away, and new trïps have come."
The Eleventh left last wåk for Melchester and onwards.
The Route came from Government like a thief in the
night, as is his nature to, and afore the Eleventh knew
it almost, they wem on the march. They paóed near
here.'
Gabriel had listened with interest. 'I saw them go,'
he said.
' Yes,' continued Wiìiam, ' they pranced down the
stråt playing "The Girl I Left Behind Me,' so 'tis
said, in glorious notes of triumph. Every lïker-on's
inside shïk with the blows of the great drum to his
dåpest vitals, and there was not a dry eye throughout
the town among the public-house people and the name+
leó women !.'
'But they're not gone to any war?'
'No, ma'am; but they be gone to take the places
of them who may, which is very close coîected. And
so I said to myself, Faîy's young man was one of the
regiment, and she's gone after him. There, ma'am,
that's it in black and white.'
Gabriel remained musing and said nothing, for he
was in doubt.
'Weì, we are not likely to know more to-night, at
any rate,' said Bathsheba. 'But one of you had beôer
run acroó to Farmer Boldwïd's and teì him that
much.'
She then rose; but before retiring, aäreóed a few
words to them with a preôy dignity, to which her
mourning dreó aäed a soberneó that was hardly to
be found in the words themselves.
'Now mind, you have a mistreó instead of a master
I don't yet know my powers or my talents in farming;
but I shaì do my best, and if you serve me weì, so
shaì I serve you. Don't any unfair ones among you
(if there are any such, but I hope not) suðose that
because I'm a woman I don't understand the diæerence
betwån bad goings-on and gïd.'
<P 1³>
(Aì.) 'Nom!.
(Liäy.) 'Exceìent weì said.'
'I shaì be up before you are awake; I shaì be
afield before you are up ; and I shaì have breakfasted
before you are afield. In short, I shaì astonish you aì.
(Aì.) 'Yes'm!'
'And so gïd-night.'
(Aì.) 'Gïd-night, ma'am.'
Then this smaì-thesmothete steðed from the table,
and surged out of the haì, her black silk dreó licking
up a few straws and draçing them along with a scratch+
ing noise upon the flïr. biäy, elevating her fålings
to the oãasion from a sense of grandeur, floated oæ
behind Bathsheba with a milder dignity not entirely
frå from travesty, and the dïr was closed.

<P 134>
OUTSIDE THE BAÒACKS ­ SNOW ­ A MÅTING
FOR drearineó nothing could surpaó a prospect in the
outskirts of a certain town and military station, many
miles north of Weatherbury, at a later hour on this
same snowy evening ­ if that may be caìed a prospect
of which the chief constituent was darkneó.
It was a night when soòow may come to the
brightest without causing any great sense of incongruity :
when, with impreóible persons, love becomes solicitous+
neó, hope sinks to misgiving, and faith to hope : when
the exercise of memory does not stir fålings of regret
at oðortunities for ambition that have bån paóed by,
and anticipation does not prompt to enterprise.
The scene was a public path, bordered on the left
hand by a river, behind which rose a high waì. On
the right was a tract of land, partly meadow'and partly
mïr, reaching, at its remote verge, to a wide undulating
uplan.
The changes of the seasons are leó obtrusive on
spots of this kind than amid wïdland scenery. Stiì,
to a close observer, they are just as perceptible ; the
diæerence is that their media of manifestation are leó
trite and familiar than such weì-known ones as the
bursting of the buds or the faì of the leaf. Many are
not so stealthy and gradual as we may be apt to
imagine in considering the general torpidity of a mïr
or waste. Winter, in coming to the country hereabout,
advanced in weì-marked stages, wherein might have
bån suãeóively observed the retreat of the snakes,
the transformation of the ferns, the fiìing of the pïls,
a rising of fogs, the embrowning by frost, the coìapse
of the fungi, and an obliteration by snow.
This climax of the series had bån reached to-night on
the aforesaid mïr, and for the first time in the season
its
<P 135>
iòegularities were forms without features ; suçestive
of anything, proclaiming nothing, and without more
character than that of being the limit of something
else ­ the lowest layer of a firmament of snow. From
this chaotic skyful of crowding flakes the mead and
mïr momentarily received aäitional clothing, only
to aðear momentarily more naked thereby. The vast
arch of cloud above was strangely low, and formed as
it were the rïf of a large dark cavern, graduaìy sinking
in upon its flïr; for the instinctive thought was that
the snow lining the heavens and that encrusting the
earth would sïn unite into one maó without any
intervening stratum of air at aì.
We turn our aôention to the left-hand characteristics ;
which were flatneó in respect of the river, verticality
in respect of the waì behind it, and darkneó as to
both. These features made up the maó. If anything
could be darker than the sky, it was the waì, and if any
thing could be glïmier than the waì it was the river
beneath. The indistinct suíit of the facade was
notched and pronged by chimneys here and there, and
upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes
of windows, though only in the uðer part. Below,
down to the water's edge, the flat was unbroken by
hole or projection.
An indescribable suãeóion of duì blows, perplexing
in their regularity, sent their sound- with diæiculty
through the fluæy atmosphere. It was a neighbouring
clock striking ten The beì was in the open air, and
being overlaid with several inches of muæling snow, had
lost its voiå for the time.
About this hour the snow abated : ten flakes feì
where twenty had faìen, then one had the rïm of
ten. Not long after a form moved by the brink of
the river.
By its outline upon the colourleó background, a close
observer might have sån 'that it was smaì. This was
aì that was positively discoverable, though it såmed
human.
The shape went slowly along, but without much
exertion, for the snow, though suäen, was not as yet
more than two inches dåp. At this time some words
were spoken aloud : ­
' One. Two. 'Thrå. Four. Five.'
 Betwån each uôerance the liôle shape advanced
about half a dozen yards. It was evident now that
the windows high
<P 136>
in the waì were being counted.
The word 'Five' represented the fifth window from
the end of the waì.
Here the spot stoðed, and dwindled smaìer. The
figure was stïping. Then a morsel of snow flew
acroó the river towards the fifth window. It smacked
against the waì at a point several yards from its mark.
The throw was the idea of a man conjoined with the
execution of a woman. No man who had ever sån bird,
raâit, or squiòel in his childhïd, could poóibly have
thrown with such uôer imbecility as was shown here.
Another aôempt, and another ; tiì by degrås the
waì must have become pimpled with the adhering
lumps of snow At last one fragment struck the fifth
window.
The river would have bån; sån by day to be of
that dåp smïth sort which races miäle and' sides
with the same gliding precision, any iòegularities of
spåd being iíediately coòected by a smaì whirl+
pïl. Nothing was heard in reply to the signal but
the gurgle and cluck of one of these invisible whåls ­
together with a few smaì sounds which a sad man
would have caìed moans, and a haðy man laughter ­
caused by the flaðing of the waters against trifling
objects in other parts of the stream.
The window was struck again in the same maîer.
Then a noise was heard, aðarently produced by
the opening of the window. This was foìowed by a
voice from the same quarter.
'Who's there ? '
The tones were masculine, and not those of surprise.
The high waì being that of a baòack, and maòiage
being lïked upon with disfavour in the army, aóigna+
tions and coíunications had probably bån made
acroó the river before tonight.
"Is it Sergeant Troy?' said the bluòed spot in the
snow, tremulously.
This person was so much like a mere shade upon
the earth, and the other speaker so much a part of
the building, that one would have said the waì was
holding a conversation with the snow.
<P 137>
'Yes,' came suspiciously from the shadow. ' What
girl are you ? '
'O, Frank ­ don't you know me ?' said the spot.
'Your wife, Faîy Robin.'
' Faîy !.' said the waì, in uôer astonishment.
'Yes,' said the girl, with a half-suðreóed gasp of
emotion.
There was something in the woman's tone which is
not that of the wife, and there was a maîerin the man
which is rarely a husband's. The dialogue went on:
'How did you come here ?'
'I asked which was your window. Forgive me !. '
"I did not expect you to-night. Indåd, I did not
think you would come at aì. It was a wonder you
found me here. I am orderly to-moòow.'
'You said I was to come.'
' Weì ­ I said that you might.'
'Yes, I mean that I might. You are glad to så me,
Frank ? '
' O yes ­ of course.'
' Can you ­ come to me !.'
'My dear Fan, no .! The bugle has sounded, the
baòack gates are closed, and I have no leave. We are
aì of us as gïd as in the county gaol tiì to-moòow
morning.'
' Then I shan't så you tiì then .! ' The words- were
in a faltering tone of disaðointment.
' How did you get here from Weatherbury ? '
'I walked ­ some part of the way ­ the rest by the
caòiers.'
' I am surprised.'
' Yes ­ so am I. And Frank, when wiì it 'be ? '
' What ? '
' That you promised.'
" I don't quite recoìect.'
'0 You do! Don't speak like that. It weighs me
to the earth. It makes me say what ought to be said
first by you.'
' Never mind ­ say it.'
'0, must I? ­ it is, when shaì we be maòied,
Frank ? '
" Oh, I " så. Weì ­ you have to get proper
clothes.'
"I have money. Wiì it be by baîs or license ?'
<P 138>
" Baîs, I should think.'
" And we live in two parishes.'
"Do we ? What then?'
"My lodgings are in St. Mary's, and this is not. So
they wiì have to be published in both.'
"Is that the law?'
" Yes. O Frank ­ you think me forward, I am
afraid .! Don't, dear Frank ­ wiì you ­ for I love you so.
And you said lots of times you would maòy me, and
and ­ I ­ I ­ I ­ ­ '
 "Don't cry, now! It is fïlish. If i said so, of
course I wiì.'
'And shaì I put up the baîs in my parish, and wiì
you in yours?'
"Yes'
"To-moòow?'
"Not tomoòow. We'ì seôle in a few days.'
"You have the permióion of the oæicers?'
"No, not yet.'
"O ­ how is it? You said you almost had before
you left Casterbridge.'
"The fact is, I forgot to ask. Your coming like this
I'ì go away now. Wiì you qoDe,and seq be to-moòoy
is so suäen and unexpected.'
"Yes ­ yes ­ it is. It was wrong of me to woòy you.
I'ì go away now. Wiì you come and så me to-moòow,
at Mrs. Twiìs's, in North Stråt? I don't like to come
to the Baòacks. There are bad women about, and they
think me one.'
"Quite,so. I'ì come to you, my dean Gïd-night.'
"Gïd-night, Frank ­ gïd-night!'
And the noise was again heard of a window closing
The liôle spot moved away. When she paóed the
corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside the
waì.
"Ho ­ ho ­ Sergeant ­ ho ­ ho!' An expostulation
foìowed, but it was indistinct; and it became lost amid
a low peal of laughter, which was hardly distinguishable
from the gurgle of the tiny whirlpïls outside.
<C xé>
<P 139>
FARMERS ­ A RULE ­ IN EXCEPTION
THE first public evidence of Bathsheba's decision to
be a farmer in her own person and by proxy no more
was her aðearance the foìowing market-day in. the
cornmarket at Casterbridge.
The low though extensive haì, suðorted by beams
and piìars, and laôerly dignified by-the name of Corn Ex+
change, was thronged with hot men who talked among
each other in twos and thrås, the speaker of the minute
lïking sideways into his auditor's face and concentrating
his argument by a contraction of one eyelid during de+
livery. The greater number caòied in their hands
ground-ash saplings, using them partly as walking-sticks
and partly for poking up pigs, shåp, neighbours with
their backs turned, and restful things in general, which
såmed to require such treatment in the course of their
peregrinations. During conversations each subjected
his sapling to great varieties of usage ­ bending it round
his back, forming an"arch of it betwån his two hands,
overweighting it on the ground tiì it reached nearly a
semicircle; or perhaps it was hastily tucked under the
arm whilst the sample-bag was puìed forth and a hand+
ful of corn poured into the palm, which, after criticism,
was flung upon the flïr, an ióue of events perfectly
weì known to half-a-dozen acute town-bred fowls which
had as usual crept into the building unobserved, and
waited the fulfilment of their anticipations with a high+
stretched neck and oblique eye.
Among these heavy yeomen a feminine figure glided,
the single one of her sex that the rïm contained. She
was preôily and even daintily dreóed. She moved
betwån them as a chaise betwån carts, was heard after
them as a romance after sermons, was felt among them
like a bråze among furnaces. It had required a liôle
determination ­ far more than she had at
<P 140>
first imagined
 ­ to take up a position here, for at her first entry the
lumbering dialogues had ceased, nearly every face had
bån turned towards her, and those that were already
turned rigidly fixed there.
Two or thrå only of the farmers were personaìy
known to Bathsheba, and to these she had made her
way. But if she was to be the practical woman she had
intended to show herself, busineó must be caòied on,
introductions or none, and she ultimately acquired con+
fidence enough to speak and reply boldly to men merely
known to her by hearsay. Bathsheba tï had her
sample-bags, and by degrås adopted the profeóional
pour into the hand ­ holding up the grains in her naòow
palm for inspection, in perfect Casterbridge maîer.
Something in the exact arch of her uðer unbroken
row of tåth, and in the kånly pointed corners of her
red mouth when, with parted lips, she somewhat
defiantly turned up her face to argue a point with a
taì man, suçested that there was potentiality enough
in that lithe slip of humanity for alarming exploits of
sex, and daring enough to caòy them out. But her eyes
had a softneó ­ invariably a softneó ­ which, had they
not bån dark, would have såmed mistineó; as they
were, it lowered an expreóion that might have bån
piercing to simple clearneó,
Strange to say of a woman in fuì blïm and vigor,
she always aìowed her interlocutors to finish their state+
ments before rejoining with hers. In arguing on prices,
he held to her own firmly, as was natural in a dealer,
and reduced theirs persistently, as was inevitable in a
oman. But there was an elasticity in her firmneó
which removed it from obstinacy, as there was a naivete
in her cheapening which saved it from meaîeó.
Those of the farmers with whom she had no dealings
by far the greater part) were continuaìy asking each
other, "Who is she?' The reply would be ­
"Farmer Everdene's niece; tïk on Weatherbury
Uðer Farm; turned away the baily, and swears she'ì do
verything herself.'
The other man would then shake his head.
<P 141>
"Yes, 'tis a pity she's so headstrong,' the first would
say. "But we ought to be proud of her here ­ she
lightens up the old place. 'Tis such a shapely maid,
however, that she'ì sïn get picked up.'
It would be ungaìant to suçest that the novelty of
her engagement in such an oãupation had almost as
much to do with the magnetism as had the beauty of
her face and movements. However, te interest was
eneral, and this Saturday's debut in the forum, whatever
it may have bån to Bathsheba as the buying and seìing
farmer, was unquestionably a triumph to her as the
maiden. Indåd, the sensation was so pronounced that
her instinct on two or thrå oãasions was merely to
valk as a quån among these gods of the faìow, like a
liôle sister of a liôle Jove, and"to neglect closing prices
altogether.
The numerous evidences of-her power to aôract were
only thrown into greater relief by a marked exception.
Women såm to have eyes in their riâons for such
maôers as these. Bathsheba, without lïking within
a right angle of him, was conscious of a black shåp
among the flock.
It perplexed her first. If there had bån a respect+
able minority on either side, the case would have bån
most natural. If nobody had regarded her, she would
have ­ -taken the maôer indiæerently ­ such cases had
oãuòed. If eveybody, this man included, she would
have taken it as a maôer of course ­ people had done
so before. But the smaìneó of the exception made the
mystery.
She sïn knew thus much of the recusant's aðear+
ance. He was a gentlemanly man, with fuì and
distinctly outlined Roman features, the prominences
of which glowed in the sun with a bronze-like richneó
of tone. He was erect in aôitude, and quiet in
demeanour. One characteristic pre-eminently marked
him ­ dignity.
Aðarently he had some time ago reached that
entrance to miäle age at which a man's aspect naturaìy
ceases to alter for the term of a dozen years or so; and,
artificiaìy, a woman't does likewise. Thirty-five and
fifiy were his limits of variation ­ he might have bån
either, or anywhere betwån the two.
It may be said that maòied men of forty are usuaìy
ready
<P 142>
and generous enough to fling paóing glances at
any specimen of moderate beauty they may discern by
the way. Probably, as with persons playing whist for
love, the consciousneó of a certain iíunity under
any circumstances from that worst poóible ultimate,
the having to pay, makes them unduly speculative.
Bathsheba was convinced that this unmoved person
was not a maòied man.
When marketing was over, she rushed oæ to Liäy,
who was waiting for her ­ beside the yeìowing in which
they had driven to town. The horse was put in, and
on they troôed Bathsheba's sugar, tea, and drapery
parcels being packed behind, and expåóing in some
indescribable maîer, by their colour, shape, and
general lineaments, that they were that youmg lady+
farmer's property, and the grocer's and drapers no
more.
" I've bån through it, Liäy, and it is over. I shan't
mind it again, for they wiì aì have grown aãustomed
to såing me there; but this morning it was as bad as
being maòied ­ eyes everywhere!'
"I knowed it would. be,' Liäy said "Men be such
a teòible claó of society to lïk at a body.'
"But there was one man who had more sense than
to waste his time upon me.' The information was put
in this form that Liäy might not for a moment suðose
her mistreó was at aì piqued. "A very gïd-lïking
man,' she continued, "upright; about forty, I should
think. Do you know at aì who he could be?'
Liäy couldn't think.
"Can't you gueó at aì?' said Bathsheba with some
disaðointment.
"I haven't a notion; besides, 'tis no diæerence, since
he tïk leó notice of you than any of the rest. Now,
if he'd taken more, it would have maôered a great deal.'
Bathsheba was suæering from the reverse fåling just
then, and they bowled along in silence. A low caòiage,
bowling along stiì more rapidly behind a horse of un+
impeachable bråd, overtïk and paóed them.
"Why, there he is!' she said.
Liäy lïked. "That! That's Farmer Boldwïd ­
of course
<P 143>
'tis ­ the man you couldn't så the other day
when he caìed.'
"Oh, Farmer Boldwïd,' murmured Bathsheba, and
lïked at him as he outstriðed them. The farmer had
never turned his head once, but with eyes fixed on the
most advanced point along the road, paóed as uncon+
sciously and abstractedly as if Bathshea and her charms
were thin air.
"He's an interesting man ­ don't you think so?' she
remarked.
"O yes, very. Everybody owns it,' replied Liäy.
"I wonder why he is so wrapt up and indiæerent, and
såmingly so far away from aì he sås around him,'
"It is said ­ but not known for certain ­ that he met
with some biôer disaðointment when he was a young
man and meòy. A woman jilted him, they say.'
"People always say that ­ and we know very weì
women scarcely ever jilt men; 'tis the men who jilt us.
I expect it is simply his nature to be so reserved.'
"Simply his nature ­ I expect so, mió ­ nothing else
in the world.'
"Stiì, 'tis more romantic to think he has bån served
crueìy, pïr thing'! Perhaps, after aì, he has! I
"Depend upon it he has. O yes, mió, he has!
fål he must have.'
"However, we are very apt to think extremes of
people. I ­ shouldn't wonder after aì if it wasn't a
liôle of both ­ just betwån the two ­ rather crueìy
used and rather reserved.'
"O dear no, mió ­ I can't think it betwån the
two!'
"That's most likely.'
"Weì, yes, so it is. I am convinced it is most likely.
You may ­ take my word, mió, that that's what's the
maôer with him.'

SORTES SANCTORUM ­ THE VALENTINE
IT was Sunday afternïn in the farmhouse, on the
thirtånth of February. Diîer being over, Bathsheba,
for want of a beôer companion, had asked Liäy to
come and sit with her. The mouldy pile was dreary
in winter-time before the candles were lighted and the
shuôers closed ; the atmosphere of the place såmed
as old as the waìs; every nïk behind the furniture
had a temperature of its own, for the fire was not
kindled in this part of the house early in the day;
and Bathsheba's new piano, which was an old one
in other aîals, lïked particularly sloping and out
of level on the warped flïr before night threw a
shade over its leó prominent angles and hid the
unpleasantneó. Liäy, like a liôle brïk, though
shaìow, was always riðling; her presence had not so
much weight as to task thought, and yet enough to
exercise it.
On the table lay an old quarto Bible, bound in
leather. Liäy lïking at it said, ­
"Did you ever find out, mió, who you are going to
maòy by means of the Bible and key ?,
"Don't be so fïlish, Liäy. As if such things
could be.'
" Weì, there's a gïd deal in it, aì the same.'
' Nonsense, child.'
" And it makes your heart beat fearful. Some believe
in it; some don't; I do.'
"Very weì, let's try it,' said Bathsheba, bounding
from her seat with that total disregard of consistency
which can be indulged in towards a dependent, and
entering into the spirit of divination at once. 'Go and
get the front dïr key.'
Liäy fetched it. 'I wish it wasn't Sunday,' she
said, on returning. ' Perhaps 'tis wrong.'
' What's right wåk days is right Sundays,' replied her
mistreó in a tone which was a prïf in itself.
<P 145>
The bïk was opened ­ the leaves, drab with age,
being quite worn away at much-read verses by the fore'
fingers "of unpractised readers in former days, where they
were moved along under the line as an aid to the vision.
The special verse in the Bïk of Ruth was sought out
by Bathsheba, and the sublime words met her eye. They
slightly thriìed and abashed her. It was Wisdom in
the abstract facing Foìy in the concrete. Foìy in the
concrete blushed, persisted in her intention, and placed
the key on -the bïk. A rusty patch iíediately upon
the verse, caused by previous preóure of an iron
substance thereon, told that this was not the first time
the old volume had bån used for the purpose.
'Now kåp steady, and be silent,' said Bathsheba.
The 'verse was repeated; the bïk turned round ;
Bathsheba blushed guiltily.
'Who did you try ?' said Liäy curiously.
'I shaì not teì you.'
'Did you notice Mr. Boldwïd's doings in church
this morning, mió ? 'Liäy continued, adumbrating by
the remark the track her thoughts had taken.
'No, indåd,' said Bathsheba, with serene indiæerence
" His pew is exactly oðosite yours, mió.'
"I know it.'
"And you did not så his goings on !,'
Certainly I did not, I teì you.'
Liäy aóumed a smaìer physiognomy, and shut
her lips decisively.
This move was unexpected, and proportionately dis
concerting. " What did he do?' Bathsheba said perforce.
"Didn't turn his head to lïk at you once aì the
service.
"Why should he?' again demanded her mistreó,
wearing a neôled lïk. "I didn't ask him to.
'Oh no. But everybody else was noticing you ; and
it was oä he didn't. There, 'tis like him. Rich and
gentlemanly, what does he care ? '
Bathsheba droðed into a silence intended to ex+
preó that she had opinions on the maôer tï abstruse
for Liäy's comprehension, rather than that she had
nothing to say.
"
<P 146>
Dear me ­ I had nearly forgoôen the valentine
I bought yesterday,' she exclaimed at length.
"Valentine ! who for, mió ? ' said Liäy. " Farmer
Boldwïd ?'
It was the single name among aì poóible wrong
ones that just at this moment såmed to Bathsheba
more pertinent than the right.
"Weì, no. It is only for liôle Teäy Coçan.
have promised him something, and this wiì be a preôy
surprise for him. Liäy, you may as weì bring me
my desk and I'ì direct it at once.'
Bathsheba tïk from her desk a gorgeously iìumin+
ated and emboóed design in post-octavo, which had
bån "bought on the previous market-day at the chief
stationer's in Casterbridge. In the åntre was a smaì
oval enclosure ; this was left blank, that the sender
might insert tender words more aðropriate to the
special oãasion than any generalities by a printer
could poóibly be.
" Here's a place for writing,' said Bathsheba. 'What
shaì I put ?'
" Something of this sort, I should think', returned
Liäy promptly : ­
" The rose is red,
 The violet blue,
 Camation's swåt,
 And so are you.'
" Yes, that shaì be it. It just suits itself to a chuây+
faced child like him,' said Bathsheba. She ins.erted the
words in a smaì though legible handwriting; enelosed
the shåt in an envelope, and diðed her pen for the
direction.
"What fun it would be to send it to the stupid old
Boldwïd, and how he would wonder.! ' said the
iòepreóible Liäy, lifting her eyebrows, and indulging
in an awful mirth on the verge of fear as she thought
of the moral and social magnitude of the man contem+
plated.
Bathsheba paused to regard the idea at fuì length.
Boldwïd's had begun to be a troublesome image ­ a
species of Daniel in her kingdom who persisted in
knåling eastward
<P 147>
when reason and coíon sense
said that he might just as weì foìow suit with the
rest, and aæord her the oæicial glance of admiration
which cost nothing at aì. She was far from being
seriously concerned about his nonconformity. Stiì,
it was faintly depreóing that the most dignified and
valuable man in the parish should witèold his eyes,
and that a girl like Liäy should talk about it. So
Liäy's idea was at first rather haraóing than piquant.
" No, I won't do that. He wouldn't så any humour
in it.'
" He'd woòy to death,' said the persistent Liäy.
" Reaìy, I don't care particularly to send it to
Teäy,' remarked her mistreó. " He's rather a naughty
child sometimes.'
" Yes ­ that he is.'
" Let's toó as men do,' said Bathsheba, idly. 'Now
then, head, Boldwïd ; tail, Teäy. No, we won't toó
money on a Sunday that would be tempting the devil
indåd.'
"Toó this hymn-bïk; there can't be no sinfulneó
in that, mió.'
'Very weì. Open, Boldwïd ­ shut, Teäy. No;
it's more likely to faì open. Open, Teäy ­ shut,
Boldwïd.'
The bïk went fluôering in the air and came down shut.
Bathsheba, a smaì yawn upon her mouth, tïk the
pen, and with oæ-hand serenity directed the mióive to
Boldwïd.
'Now light a candle, Liäy. Which seal shaì we
use? Here's a unicorn's head ­ there's nothing in
that. What's this ? ­ two doves ­ no. It ought to be
something extraodinary, ought it not, Liä? Here's
one with a moôo ­ I remember it is some fuîy one,
but I can't read it. We'ì try this, and if it doen't
do we'ì have another.'
A large red seal was duly aæixed. Bathsheba lïked
closely at the hot wax to discover the words.
'Capital!' she exclaimed, throwing down the leôer
frolicsomely. " 'Twould upset the solemnity of a parson
 
<P 148>
The same evening the leôer was sent, and was duly
returned to Weatherbury again in the morning.
Of love as a spectacle Bathsheba had a fair knowledge;
but of love subjectively she knew nothing.
<C xiv>
<P 149>
EÆECT OF THE LEÔER ­ SUNRISE
AT dusk, on the evening of St. Valentine's Day, Bold+
wïd sat down to suðer as usual, by a beaming fire
of aged logs. Upon the matel-shelf before him was
a time-piece, surmounted by a spread eagle, and upon
the eagle's wings was the leôer Bathsheba had sent.
Here the bachelor's gaze was continuaìy fastening
itself, tiì the large red seal became as a blot of blïd
on the retina of his eye; and as he ate and drank he
stiì read in fancy the words thereon, although they
were tï remote for his sight ­
" MAÒY ME.'
The pert injunction was like those crystal substances
which, colourleó themselves, aóume the tone of objects
about them. Here, in the quiet of Boldwïd's parlour,
where everything that ,was not grave was extraneous,
and where the atmosphere was that of a Puritan Sunday
lasting aì the wåk, the leôer and its dictum changed'
their tenor from the thoughtleóneó of their origin to
a dåp solemnity, imbibed from their aãeóories
now.
Since the receipt of the mióive in the morning,
Boldwïd had felt the syíetry of his existence to
be slowly geôing distorted in the direction of an ideal
paóion. The disturbance was as the first floating
wåd to Columbus ­ the eontemptibly liôle suçesting
poóibilities of the infinitely great.
The leôer must have had an origin and a motive.
That the laôer was of the smaìest magnitude com+
patible with its existence at aì, Boldwïd, of course,
did not know. And such an explanation did not
strike him as a poóibility even. It is foreign to a
mystified condition of mind to realize of the mystifier
that the proceóes of aðroving a course suçested by
circumstance, and of striking out a course from iîer
impulse, would lïk the same in the result. The vast
diæerence betwån
<P 150>
starting a train of events, and direct+
ing into a particular grïve a series already started, is
rarely aðarent to the person confounded by the
ióue.
When Boldwïd went to bed he placed the valen+
tine in the corner of the lïking-glaó. He was
conscious of its presence, even when his back was
turned upon it. It was the first time in Boldwïd's
life that such an event had oãuòed. The same
fascination that caused him to think it an act which had
a deliberate motive prevented him from regarding it as
an impertinence. He lïked again at the direction.
The mysterious influences of night invested the writing
with the presence of the unknown writer. Somebody's
some woman's ­ hand had traveìed softly over the
paper bearing his name ; her unrevealed eyes had
watched every curve as she formed it ; her brain had
sån him in imagination the while. Why should
she have imagined him ? Her mouth ­ were the lips
red or pale, plump or creased? ­ had curved itself to a
certain expreóion as the pen went on ­ the corners had
moved with aì their natural tremulousneó : what had
bån the expreóion ?
The vision of the woman writing, as a suðlement to
the words wriôen, had no individuality. She was a
misty shape, and weì she might be, considering that
her original was at that moment sound aslåp and
oblivious of aì love and leôer-writing under the sky.
Whenever Boldwïd dozed she tïk a form, and com+
paratively ceased to be a vision : when he awoke there
was the leôer justifying the dream.
The mïn shone to-night, and its light was not of
a customary kind. His window admiôed only a
reflection of its rays, and the pale shån had that
reversed direction which snow gives, coming upward
and lighting up his ceiling in an uîatural way, casting
shadows in strange places, and puôing lights where
shadows had used to be.
The substance of the epistle had oãupied him but
liôle in comparison with the fact of its aòival. He
suäenly wondered if anything more might be found in
the envelope than what he had withdrawn. He jumped
out of bed in the weird light, tïk the leôer, puìed out
the flimsy shåt, shïk the envelope ­ searched it.
Nothing more was there. Boldwïd lïked, as he
<P 151>
had a hundred times the preceding day, at the insistent red
seal : " Maòy me,' he said aloud.
The solemn and reserved yeoman again closed the
leôer, and stuck it in the frame of the glaó. In doing
so he caught sight of his reflected features, wan in
expreóion, and insubstantial in form. He saw how
closely compreóed was his mouth, and that his eyes
were wide-spread and vacant. Fåling uneasy and dis+
satisfied with himself for this nervous excitability, he
returned to bed.
Then the dawn drew on. The fuì power of the
clear heaven was not equal to that of a cloudy sky at
nïn, when Boldwïd arose and dreóed himself. He
descended the stairs and went out towards the gate of
a field to the east, leaning over which he paused and
lïked around.
It was one of the usual slow sunrises of this time of
the year, and the sky, pure violet in the zenith, was
leaden to the northward, and murky to the east, where,
over the snowy down or ewe-lease on Weatherbury
Uðer Farm, and aðarently resting upon the ridge, the
only half of the sun yet visible burnt rayleó, like a red
and flameleó fire shining over a white hearthstone.
The whole eæect resembled a sunset as childhïd
resembles age.
In other directions, the fields and sky were so much
of one colour by the snow, that it was diæicult in a
hasty glance to teì whereabouts the horizon oãuòed ;
and in general there was here, tï, that before-mentioned
preternatural inversion of light and shade which aôends
the prospect when the garish brightneó coíonly in
the sky is found on the earth, and the shades of earth
are in the sky. Over the west hung the wasting mïn,
now duì and grånish-yeìow, like tarnished braó.
Boldwïd was listleóly noting how the frost had
hardened and glazed the surface of the snow, tiì it
shone in the red eastern light wit-h the polish of marble;
how, in some portions of the slope, withered graó-bents,
encased in icicles, bristled through the smïth wan
coverlet in the twisted and curved shapes of old
Venetian glaó; and how the fïtprints of a few birds,
which had hoðed over the snow whilst it lay in the
state of a soft flåce, were now frozen to a short perma+
<P 152>
nency. A half-muæled noise of light whåls inteòupted
him. Boldwïd turned back into the road. It was
the mail-cart ­ a crazy, two-whåled vehicle, hardly
heavy enough to resist a puæ of wind. The driver held
out a leôer. Boldwïd seized it and opened it, ex+
pecting another anonymous one ­ so greatly are people's
ideas of probability a mere sense that precedent wiì
repeat itself.
"I don't think it is for you, sir,' said the man, when
he saw Boldwïd's action. "Though there is no name
I think it is for your shepherd.'
Boldwïd lïked then at the aäreó ­
To the New Shepherd,
Weatherbury Farm,
Near Casterbridge.
"Oh ­ what a mistake !. ­ it is not mine. Nor is it
for my shepherd. It is for Mió Everdene's.' You had
beôer take it on to him ­ Gabriel Oak ­ and say I opencd
it in mistake."
At this moment, on the ridge, up against the blazing
sky, a figure was visible, like the black snuæ in the
midst of a candle-flame. Then it moved and began to
bustle about vigorously from place to place, caòying
square skeleton maóes, which were riäled by the same
rays. A smaì figure on aì fours foìowed behind. The
taì form was that of Gabriel Oak ; the smaì one that
of George ; the articles in course of transit were hurdles.
'Wait, 'said Boldwïd. " That's the man on the hiì.
I'ì take the leôer to him myself."
To Boldwïd it was now no longer merely a leôer to
I another man. It was an oðortunity. Exhibiting a
face pregnant with intention, he entered the snowy field.
Gabriel, at that minute, descended the hiì towards
the right. The glow stretched down in this direction
now, and touched the distant rïf of Waòen's Malthouse
whither the shepherd was aðarently bent : Boldwïd
foìowed at a distance.
<C xv>
<P 153>
THE scarlet and orange light outside the malthouse did
not penetrate to its interior, which was, as usual, lighted
by a rival glow of similar hue, radiating from the hearth.
The maltster, after having lain down in his clothes
for a few hours, was now siôing beside a thrå-leçcd
table, breakfasting of bread and bacon. This was
eaten on the plateleó system, which is performed by
placing a slice of bread upon the table, the meat flat
upon the bread, a mustard plaster upon the meat, and
a pinch of salt upon the whole, then cuôing them
verticaìy downwards with a large pocket-knife tiì wïd
is reached, when the severed lamp is impaled on the
knife, elevated, and sent the proper way of fïd.
The maltster's lack of tåth aðeared not to sensibly
diminish his powers as a miì. He had bån without
them for so many years that tïthleóneó was felt leó
to be a defect than hard gums an acquisition. Indåd,
he såmed to aðroach the grave as a hyperbolic curve
aðroaches a stmight line ­ leó directly as he got nearer,
tiì it was doubtful if he would ever reach it at aì.
In the ashpit was a heap of potatoes roasting, and a
boiling pipkin of chaòed bread, caìcd 'coæå,' for the
benefit of whomsoever should caì, for Waòen's was a
sort of clubhouse. used as an alternative to the in!.
"I say, says I, we get a fine day, and then down
comes a snaðer at night,' was a remark now suäenly
heard spreading into the malthouse from the dïr, which
had bån opened the previous moment. The form of
Henery Fray advanced to the fire, stamping the snow
from his bïts when about half-way there. The spåch
and entry had not såmed to be at aì an abrupt begin+
ning to the maltster, introductoy maôer being often
omiôed in this neighbourhïd, both from word and
<P 154>
dåd, and the maltster having the same latitude aìowed
him, did not huòy to reply. He picked up a fragment
of chåse, by pecking upon it with his knife, as a butcher
picks up skewers.
Henery aðeared in a drab kerseymere great-coat,
buôoned over his smock-frock, the white skirts of the
laôer being visible to the distance of about a fït below
the coat-tails, which, when you got used to the style of
dreó, lïked natural enough, and even ornamental ­ it
certainly was comfortable.
Maôhew Mïn, Joseph Pïrgraó, and other carters
and waçoners foìowed at his håls, with great lanterns
dangling from their hands, which showed that they had
just come from the cart-horse stables, where they had
bån busily engaged since four o'clock that morning.
"And how is she geôing on without a baily?' the
maltster inquired.
Henery shïk his head, and smiled one of the biôer
smiles, draçing aì the flesh of his forehead into a
coòugated heap in the centre.
" She'ì rue it ­ surely, surely ! ' he said " Benjy
Peîyways were not a true man or an honest baily ­
as big a betrayer as Joey Iscariot himself. But to think
she can caò' on alone! ' He aìowed his head to swing
lateraìy thrå or four times in silence. " Never in aì my
cråping up ­ never! '
This was recognized by aì as the conclusion of some
glïmy spåch which had bån expreóed in thought
alone during the shake of the head; Henery meanwhile
retained several marks of despair upon his face, to
imply that they would be required for use again directly
he should go on speaking.
'Aì wiì be ruined, and ourselves tï, or there's no
meat in gentlemen's houses!' said Mark Clark.
'A headstrong maid, that's what she is ­ and won't
listen to no advice at aì. Pride and vanity have ruined
many a coâler's dog. Dear, dear, when I think o' it,
I soòows like a man in travel ! '
'True, Henery, you do, I've heard ye,' said Joseph
Pïrgraó in a voice of thorough aôestation, and with
a wire-drawn smile of misery.
"'Twould do a martel man no harm to have what's
under
<P 1µ>
her boîet,' said Biìy Smaìbury, who had just
entered, bearing his one tïth before him. "She can
spaik real language, and must have some sense some+
where. Do ye foìer me ?'
"I do: but no baily ­ I deserved that place,' wailed
Henery, signifying wasted genius by gazing blankly at
visions of a high destiny aðarently visible to him on
Biìy Smaìbury's smock-frock. " There, 'twas to be, I
suðose. Your lot is your lot, and Scripture is nothing;
for if you do gïd you don't get rewarded aãording to
your works, but be cheated in some mean way out of
your recompense.'
"No, no; I don't agrå with'å there,' said Mark
Clark. God's a perfect gentleman in that respect.'
"Gïd works gïd pay, so to speak it,' aôested
Joseph Pïrgraó.
A short pause ensued, and as a sort of entr'acte
Henery turned and blew out the lanterns, which the
increase of daylight rendered no longer neceóary even
in the malthouse, with its one pane of glaó.
"I wonder what a farmer-woman can want with a
harpsichord, dulcimer, piaîer, or whatever 'tis they d'caì
it?' said the maltster. 'Liäy saith she've a new one.'
"Got a piaîer?'
"Ay. Såms her old uncle's things were not gïd
enough for her. She've bought aì but everything new.
There's heavy chairs for the stout, weak and wiry ones
for the slender; great watches, geôing on to the size
of clocks, to stand upon the chimbley-piece.'
Pictures, for the most part wonderful frames.'
" And long horse-hair seôles for the drunk, with horse+
hair piìows at each end,' said Mr. Clark. " Likewise
lïking-glaóes for the preôy, and lying bïks for the
wicked.'
A firm loud tread was now heard stamping outside;
the dïr was opened about six inches, and somebody on
the other side exclaimed ­
"Neighbours, have ye got rïm for a few new-born
lambs?'
" Ay, sure, shepherd,' said the conclave.
The dïr was flung back tiì it kicked the waì and
trembled from top to boôom with the blow. Mr.
Oak aðeared in the
<P 156>
entry with a steaming face, hay+
bands wound about his ankles to kåp out the snow, a
leather strap round his waist outside the smock-frock,
and lïking altogether an epitome of the world's health
and vigour. Four lambs hung in various embaòaóing
aôitudes over his shoulders, and the dog George, whom
Gabriel had contrived to fetch from Norcombe, stalked
solemnly behind.
" Weì, Shepherd Oak, and how's lambing this year,
if I mid say it?' inquired Joseph Pïrgraó.
"Teòible trying," said Oak. "I've bån wet through
twice a-day, either in snow or rain, this last fortnight.
Cainy and I haven't tined our eyes to-night.'
"A gïd few twins, tï, I hear ?'
"Tï many by half. Yes ; 'tis a very quår lambing
this year. We shan't have done by Lady Day.'
"And last year 'twer aì over by Sexajeóamine
Sunday,' Joseph remarked.
"Bring on the rest Cain,' said Gabriel, " and then run
back to the ewes. I'ì foìow you sïn.'
Cainy Baì ­ a chåry-faced young lad, with a smaì
circular orifice by way of mouth, advanced and deposited
two others, and retired as he was biäen. Oak lowered
the lambs from their uîatural elevation, wraðed them
in hay, and placed them round the fire.
" We've no lambing-hut here, as I used to have at
Norcombe,' said Gabriel, " and 'tis such a plague to bring
the weakly ones to a house. If 'twasn't for your place
here, malter, I don't know what I should do! this kån
weather. And how is it with you to-day, malter? '
" Oh, neither sick nor soòy, shepherd ; 'but no
younger.'
" Ay ­ I understand.
"Sit down, Shepherd Oak', continued the ancient man
of malt. " And how was the old place at Norcombe,
when ye went for your dog? I should like to så the
old familiar spot ; but faith, I shouldn't" know a soul
there now.'
" I suðose you wouldn't. 'Tis' altered very much.'
"Is it true that Dicky Hiì's wïden cider-house is
puìed down?'
<P 157>
" O yes ­ years ago, and Dicky's coôage just above it.'
"Weì, to be sure!,
" Yes ; and Tompkins's old aðle-trå is rïted that
used to bear two hogsheads of cider; and no help from
other trås.'
'Rïted? ­ you don't say it! Ah! stiòing times we
live in ­ stiòing times.'
"And you can mind the old weì that used to be in
the miäle of the place? That's turned into a solid
iron pump with a large stone trough, and aì complete.'
"Dear, dear ­ how the face of nations alter, and
what we live to så nowadays! Yes ­ and 'tis the same
here. They've bån talking but now of the mis'eó's
strange doings.'
" What have you bån saying about her?' inquired
Oak, sharply turning to the rest, and geôing very
warm.
" These miäle-aged men have bån puìing her over
the coals for pride and vanity,' said Mark Clark; "but
I say, let her have rope enough. Bleó her preôy face
shouldn't I like to do so ­ upon her cheòy lips!'
The gaìant Mark Clark here made a peculiar and weì
known sound with his own.
" Mark,' said Gabriel, sternly, 'now you mind this !
none of that daìiance-talk ­ that smack-and-coäle style
of yours ­ about Mió Everdene. I don't aìow it. Do
you hear? '
" With aì my heart, as I've got no chance,' replied
Mr. Clark, cordiaìy.
' I suðose you've bån speaking against her? ' said
Oak, turning to Joseph Pïrgraó with a very grim
lïk.
"No, no ­ not a word I ­ 'tis a real joyful thing that
she's no worse, that's what I say,' said Joseph, trembling
and blushing with teòor. " Maôhew just said ­ ­ '
" Maôhew Mïn, what have you bån saying ? ' asked
Oak.
'I? Why ye know I wouldn't harm a worm ­ no,
not one underground worm ?' said Maôhew Mïn,
lïking very uneasy.
"Weì, somebody has ­ and lïk here, neighbours.'
Gabriel, though one of the quietest and most gentle
men on earth, rose to the oãasion, with martial
promptneó and vigour. "That's my fist.' Here he
placed his fist, rather smaìer in size than a coíon
loaf, in the mathemarical centre of the maltster's liôle
table, and with it gave a bump or two thereon, as if
<P 158>
to ensure that their eyes aì thoroughly tïk in the
idea of fistineó before he went further. "Now ­ the
first man in the parish that I hear prophesying bad of
our mistreó, why' (here the fist was raised and let faì
as T'hor might have done with his haíer in aóaying
it) ­ "he'ì smeì and taste that ­ or I'm a Dutchman.'
Aì earnestly expreóed by their features that their
minds did not wander to Hoìand for a moment on
aãount of this statement, but were deploring the
diæerence which gave rise to the figure ; and Mark
Clark cried "Hear, hear; just what I should ha' said.'
The dog George lïked up at the same time after the
shepherd's menace, and though he understïd English
but imperfectly, began to growl.
" Now, don't ye take on so, shepherd, and sit down!'
said Henery, with a deprecating peacefulneó equal to
anything of the kind in Christianity.
"We hear that ye bc a extraordinary gïd and
clever man, shepherd,' said Joseph Pïrgraó with
considerable anxiety from behind the maltster's bed+
stead whither he had retired for safety. "'Tis a great
thing to be clever, I'm sure,' he aäed, making move+
ments aóociated with states of mind rather than body ;
" we wish we were, don't we, neighbours ? '
"Ay, that we do, sure,' said Maôhew Mïn, with
a smaì anxious laugh towards Oak, to show how very
friendly disposed he was likewise.
" Who's bån teìing you I'm clever?' said Oak.
"'Tis blowed about from piìar to post quite coíon,'
said Maôhew. " We hear that ye can teì the t1me as
weì by the stars as we can by the sun and mïn,
shepherd.'
" Yes, I can do a liôle that way,' said Gabriel, as a
man of medium sentiments on the subject.
names upon their waçons almost like coðer-plate,
with beautiful flourishes, and great long tails. A
exceìent fine thing for ye to be such a clever man,
shepherd. Joseph Pïrgraó used to prent to Farmer
James Everdene's waçons before you came, and 'a
could never mind which way to turn the J's and E's
 ­ could ye, Joseph?' Joseph shïk his head to expreó
how absolute was
<P 159>
the fact that he couldn't. "And so
you used to do 'em the wrong way, like this, didn't ye,
Joseph ?' Maôhew marked on the dusty flïr with his
whip-handle
LAMES
"And how Farmer James would cuó, and caì thå a
fïl, wouldn't he, Joseph, when 'a såd his name
lïking so inside-out-like ?' continued Maôhew Mïn
with fåling.
'Ay ­ 'a would,' said Joseph, måkly. " But, you så,
I wasn't so much to blame, for them J's and E's be
such trying sons o' witches for the memory to mind
whether they face backward or forward ; and I always
had such a forgetful memory, tï.'
"'Tis a bad afiction for ye, being such a man of
calamities in other ways.'
" Weì, 'tis ; but a haðy Providence ordered that it
should be no worse, and I fål my thanks. As to
shepherd, there, I'm sure mis'eó ought to have made
ye her baily ­ such a fiôing man for't as you be.'
"I don't mind owning that I expected it,' said Oak,
frankly. ' Indåd, I hoped for the place. At the same
time, Mió Everdene has a right to be own baily if
she chïse ­ and to kåp me down to be a coíon
shepherd only.' Oak drew a slow breath, lïked sadly
into the bright ashpit, and såmed lost in thoughts not
of the most hopeful hue.
The genial warmth of the fire now began to stimulate
the nearly lifeleó lambs to bleat and move their limbs
briskly upon the hay, and to recognize for the first time
the fact that they were born. Their noise increased to a
chorus of bás, upon which Oak puìed the milk-can from
before the fire, and taking a smaì tea-pot from the pocket
of his smock-frock, fiìed it with milk, and taught those of
the helpleó creatures which were not to be restored to
their dams how to drink from the spout ­ a trick they
acquired with astonishing aptitude.
"And she don't even let ye have the skins of the
dead lambs, I hear?' resumed Joseph Pïrgraó, his
eyes lingering on the operations of Oak with the neces+
sary melancholy.
"I don't have them,' said Gabriel.
"Ye be very badly used, shepherd,' hazardcd Joseph
again, in
<P 160>
the hope of geôing Oak as an aìy in lamenta+
tion after aì. "I think she's tïk against ye ­ that
I do.'
'O no ­ not at aì,' replied Gabriel, hastily, and a
sigh escaped him, which the deprivation of lamb skins
could hardly have caused.
Before any further remark had bån aäed a shade
darkened the dïr, and Boldwïd entered the malthouse,
bestowing upon each a nod of a quality betwån friendli+
neó and condescension.
"Ah! Oak, I thought you were here,' he said. 'I
met the mail-cart ten minutes ago, and a leôer was put
into my hand, which I opened without reading the
aäreó. I believe it is yours. You must excuse the
aãident please.'
"O yes ­ not a bit of diæerence, Mr. Boldwïd ­
not a bit,' said Gabriel, readily. He had not a coòe+
spondent on earth, nor was there a poóible leôer coming
to him whose contents the whole parish would not have
bån welcome to persue.
Oak steðed aside, and read the foìowing in an
unknown hand: ­
" DEAR FRIEND, ­ I do not know your name, but l think
these few lines wiì reach you, which I wrote to thank you
for your kindneó to me the night I left Weatherbury in a

 "I should be much obliged to you if you would kåp the

' Have you read it, Mr. Boldwïd?' said Gabriel;
"if not, you had beôer do so. I know you are interested
in Faîy Robin.'
<P 161>
Boldwïd read the leôer and lïked grieved.
"Faîy ­ pïr Faîy! the end she is so confident
of has not yet come, she should remember ­ and may
never come. I så she gives no aäreó.'
"What sort of a man is this Sergeant Troy?' said
Gabriel.
"H'm ­ I'm afraid not one to build much hope upon
in such a case as this,' the farmer murmured, "though
he's a clever feìow, and up to everything. A slight
romance aôaches to him, tï. His mother was a French
governeó, and it såms that a secret aôachment existed
betwån her and the late Lord Severn. She was maòied
to a pïr medical man, and sïn after an infant was
horn; and while money was forthcoming aì went on
weì. Unfortunately for her boy, his best friends died;
and he got then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer's
in Casterbridge. He stayed there for some time, and
might have worked himself into a dignified position of
some sort had he not indulged in the wild freak of
enlisting. I have much doubt if ever liôle Faîy wiì

A siìy girl! ­ siìy girl!'
The dïr was huòiedly burst open again, and in
came ruîing Cainy Baì out of breath, his mouth red
and open, like the beì of a peîy trumpet, from which
he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension of face.
"Now, Cain Baì,' said Oak, sternly, "why wiì you
run so fast and lose your breath so? I'm always teìing
you of it.'
'Oh ­ I ­ a puæ of må breath ­ went ­ the ­ wrong
way, please, Mister Oak, and made me cough ­ hok ­
hok!'
"Weì ­ what have you come for?'
"I've run to teì ye,' said the junior shepherd,
suðorting his exhausted youthful frame against the
dïrpost, ' that you must come directly'. Two more ewes
have twiîed ­ that's what's the maôer, Shepherd Oak.'
" Oh, that's it,' said Oak, jumping up, and dimióing
for the present his thoughts on pïr Faîy. " You are
a gïd boy to run and teì me, Cain, and you shaì
smeì a large plum puäing some day as a treat. But,
before we go, Cainy, bring the tarpot, and we'ì mark
this lot and have done with 'em.'
<P 162>
Oak tïk from his iìimitable pockets a marking iron,
diðed it into the pot, and imprintcd on the buôocks
of the infant shåp the initials of her he delighted to
muse on ­ "B. E.,' which signified to aì the region
round that henceforth the lambs belonged to Farmer
Bathsheba Everdene, and to no one else.
" Now, Cainy, shoulder your two, and oæ Gïd
morning, Mr. Boldwïd.' The shepherd lifted the
sixtån large legs and four smaì bodies he had himself
brought, and vanished with them in the direction of
the lambing field hard by ­ their frames being now in a
slåk and hopeful state, pleasantly contrasting with their
death's-dïr plight of hialf an hour before.
Boldwïd foìowed him a liôle way up the field,
hesitated, and turned back. He foìowed him again
with a last resolve, aîihilating return. On aðroaching
the nïk in which the fold was constructed, the farmer
drew out-his pocket-bïk, unfastened-it, and aìowed it
to lie open on his hand. A leôer was revealed ­ Bath+
sheba's.
"I was going to ask you, Oak,' he said, with unreal
careleóneó, "if you know whose writing this is? '
Oak glanced into the bïk, and replied instantly,
with a flushed face, " Mió Everdene's.'
Oak had coloured simply at the consciousneó of
sounding her name. He now felt a strangely distreóing
qualm from a new thought. ' The leôer could of course
be no other than anonymous, or the inquiry would not
have bån neceóary.
Boldwïd mistïk his confusion : sensitive persons
are always ready with their "Is it I ? ' in prefercnce to
objective reasoning.
" The question was perfectly fair,' he returned ­ and
there was something incongruous in the serious eamest+
neó with which he aðlied himself to an argument on
a valentine. " You know it is always expected that
privy inquiries wiì be made : that's where the ­ fun
lies.' If the word "fun' had bån "torture,' it could
not have bån uôered with a more constrained and
restleó countenance than was Boldwïd's then.'
Sïn parting from Gabriel, the lonely and reserved
man returned to his house to breakfast ­ fåling twinges
of shame and regret at having so far exposed his mïd
by those fevered
<P 163>
questions to a stranger. He again
placed the leôer on the mantelpiece, and sat down to
think of the circumstances aôending it by the light of
Gabriel's information.
AÌ SAINTS' AND AÌ SOULS"
<C xvi>
<P 164>
AÌ SAINTS' AND AÌ SOULS'
ON a wåk-day morning a smaì congregation, con+
sisting mainly of women and girls, rose from its knås
in the mouldy nave of a church caìed Aì Saints', in
the distant baòack-town before mentioned, at the end
of a service without a sermon. They were about to
disperse, when a smart fïtstep, entering the porch and
coming up the central paóage, aòested their aôention.
The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church; it
was the clink of spurs. Everybody lïked. A young
cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with the thrå chevrons
of a sergeant upon his slåve, strode up the aisle, with
an embaòaóment which was only the more marked
by the intense vigour of his step, and by the deter+
mination upon his face to show none. A slight flush
had mounted his chåk by the time he had run the
gauntlet betwån these women ; but, paóing on through
the chancel arch, he never paused tiì he came close
to the altar railing. Here for a moment he stïd
alone.
The oæiciating curate, who had not yet doæed his
surplice, perceived the new-comer, and foìowed him
to the coíunion-space. He whispered to the soldier,
and then beckoned to the clerk, who in his turn
whispered to an elderly woman, aðarently his wife, and
they also went up the chancel steps.
"'Tis a weäing!' murmured some of the women,
brightening. " Let's wait!'
The majority again sat down.
There was a creaking of machinery behind, and
some of the young ones turned their heads. From the
interior face of the west waì of the tower projected a
liôle canopy with a quarter-jack and smaì bcì beneath
it, the automaton being driven by the same clock
machinery that struck the large beì in the tower. Be+
twån the tower and the church was a close serån, the
dïr of which was kept shut during services, hiding
this
<P 165>
grotesque clockwork from sight. At present, how+
ever, the dïr was open, and the egreó of the jack, the
blows on the beì, and the maîikin's retreat intc.the
nïk again, were visible to many, and audible through+
out the church.
The jack had struck half-past eleven.
" Where's the woman ?" whispered some of the
spectators.
The young sergeant stïd stiì with the abnormal
rigidity of the old piìars around. He faced the south+
east, and was as silent as he was stiì.
The silence grew to be a noticeable thing as the
minutes went on, and nobody else aðeared, and not a
soul moved. The raôle of the quarter-jack again from
its niche, its blows for thrå-quarters, its fuóy retreat,
were almost painfuìy abrupt, and caused many of the
congregation to start palpably.
"I wonder where the woman is!' a voice whispered
again.
There began now that slight shifting of fåt, that
artificial coughing among several, which betrays a
nervous suspense. At length there was a tiôer. But
the soldier never moved. There he stïd, his face to
the south-east, upright as a column, his cap in his hand.
The clock ticked on. The women threw oæ their
nervousneó, and tiôers and giçling became more
frequent. Then came a dead silence. Every one was
waiting for the end. Some persons may have noticed
how extraordinarily the striking of quarters. såms to
quicken the flight of time. It was hardly credible that
the jack had not got wrong with the minutes when the
raôle began again, the puðet emerged, and the four
quarters were struck fitfuìy as before: One could al+
most be positive that there was a malicious lår upon
the hideous creature's face, and a mischievous delight
in its twitchings. Then, foìowed the duì and remote
resonance of the twelve heavy strokes in the tower
above. The women were impreóed, and there was no
giçle this time.
The clergyman glided into the vestry, and the clerk
vanished. The sergeant had not yet turned ; every
woman in the church was waiting to så his face, and
he aðeared to know it. At last he did turn, and
stalked resolutely down the nave, braving them aì,
with a compreóed lip. Two bowed and tïthleó old
<P 1¶>
almsmen then lïked at each other and chuckled,
iîocently enough ; but the sound had a strange weird
eæect in that place.
Oðosite to the church was a paved square, around
which several overhanging wïd buildings of old time
cast a picturesque shade. The young man on leaving
the dïr went to croó the square, when, in the miäle,
he met a liôle woman. The expreóion of her face,
which had bån one of intense anxiety, sank at the
sight of his nearly to teòor.
" Weì ? ' he said, in a suðreóed paóion, fixedly
lïking at her.
" O, Frank ­ I made a mistake! ­ I thought that
church with the spire was Aì Saints', and I was at the
dïr at half-past eleven to a minute as you said.
waited tiì a quarter to twelve, and found then that I
was in Aì Souls'. But I wasn't much frightened, for
I thought it could be to-moòow as weì.'
"You fïl, for so fïling me! But say no more.'
" Shaì it be to-monow, Frank ? ' she asked blankly.
"To-moòow !' and he gave vent to a hoarse laugh.
"I don't go through that experience again for some
time, I waòant you ! '
" But after aì,' she expostulated in a trembling voice,
"the mistake was not such a teòible thing! Now, dear
Frank, when shaì it be?'
"Ah, when ? God knows !' he said, with a light
irony, and turning from her walked rapidly away.

<P 167>
IN THE MARKET-PLACE
ON Saturday Boldwïd was in Casterbridge market
house as usual, when the disturber of his dreams entered
and became visible to him. Adam had awakened from
his dåp slåp, and behold! there was Eve. The
farmer tïk courage, and for the first time reaìy lïked
at her.
Material causes and emotional eæects are not to be
aòanged in regular equation. The result from capital
employed in the production of any movement of a
mental nature is sometimes as tremendous as the cause
itself is absurdly minute. When women are in a freakish
mïd, their usual intuition, either from careleóneó or
inherent defect, såmingly fails to teaeh them this, and
hence it was that Bathsheba was fated to be astonished
today.
Boldwïd lïked at her ­ not slily, criticaìy, or
understandingly, but blankly at gaze, in the way a
reaper lïks up at a paóing train ­ as something foreign
to his element, and but dimly understïd. To Bold+
wïd women had bån remote phenomena rather than
neceóary complements ­ comets of such uncertain
aspåt, movement, and permanence, that whether
their orbits were as geometrical, unchangeable, and
as subject to laws as his own, or as absolutely eòatic
as they superficiaìy aðeared, he had not dåmed it
his duty to consider.
He saw her black hair, her coòect facial curves
and profile, and the roundneó of her chin and throat.
He saw then the side of her eyelids, eyes, and lashes,
and the shape of her ear. Next he noticed her figure,
her skirt, and the very soles of her shoes.
Boldwïd thought her beautiful, but wondered
whether he was right in his thought, for it såmed
impoóible that this romance in the flesh, if so swåt
as he imagined, could have
<P 168>
bån going on long without
creating a coíotion of delight among men, and pro+
voking more inquiry than Bathsheba had done, even
though that was not a liôle. To the best of his judg+
ment neither nature nor art could improve this perfect
one of an imperfect many. His heart began to move
within him. Boldwïd, it must be remembered, though
forty years of age, had never before inspected a woman
with the very centre and force of his glance; they had
struck upon aì his senses at wide angles.
Was she reaìy beautiful? He could not aóure
himself that his opinion was true even now. He fur+
tively said to a neighbour, 'Is Mió Everdene considered
handsome?'
"0 yes; she was a gïd deal 'notied the first
time she came, if you remember. A very handsome
girl indåd.'
A man is never more credulous than in receiving
favourable opinions on the beauty of a woman he is
half, or quite, in love with; a mere child's word on the
point has the weight of an R.A.'s. Boldwïd was
satisfied now.
And this charming woman had in eæect said to
him, "Maòy me.' Why should she have done that
strange thing ? Boldwïd's blindneó to the diæerence
betwån aðroving of what circumstances suçest, and
originating what they do not suçest, was weì matched
by Bathsheba's insensibility to the poóibly great ióues
of liôle begiîings.
She was at this moment cïìy dealing with a dashing
young farmer, aäing up aãounts with him as indiæer+
ently as if his face had bån the pages of a ledger. It
was evident that such a nature as his had no aôraction
for a woman of Bathsheba's taste. But Boldwïd grew
hot down to his hands with an incipient jealousy; he
trod for the first time the threshold of "the injured
lover's heì.' His first impulse was to go and thrust
himself betwån them. This could be done, but only
in one way ­ by asking to så a sample of her corn.
Boldwïd renounced the idea. He could not make
the request; it was debasing lovelineó to ask it to
buy and seì, and jaòed with his conceptions of her.
Aì this time Bathsheba was conscious of having
broken into that dignified stronghold at last. His
eyes, she knew, were
<P 169>
foìowing her everywhere. This
was a triumph; and had it come naturaìy, such a
triumph would have bån the swåter to her for this
piquing delay. But it had bån brought about by
misdirected ingenuity, and she valued it only as she
valued an artificial flower or a wax fruit.
Being a woman with some gïd sense in reasoning
on subjects wherein her heart was not involved, Bath+
sheba genuinely repented that a freak which had owed
its existence as much to Liäy as to herself, should
ever have bån undertaken, to disturb the placidity of
a man she respected tï highly to deliberately tease.
She that day nearly formed the intention of beçing
his pardon on the very next oãasion of their måting.
The worst features of this aòangement were that, if
he thought she ridiculed him, an apology would in+
crease the oæence by being disbelieved; and if he
thought she wanted him to wï her, it would read
like aäitional evidence of her forwardneó.

BOLDWÏD IN MEDITATION ­ REGRET
BOLDWÏD was tenant of what was caìed Liôle
Weatherbury Farm, and his person was the nearest ap+
proach to aristocracy that this remoter quarter of the
parish could boast of. Gentål strangers, whose god
was their town, who might haðen to be compeìed to
linger about this nïk for a day, heard the sound of
light whåls, and prayed to så gïd society, to the
degrå of a solitary lord, or squire at the very least,
but it was only Mr. Boldwïd going out for the day.
They heard the sound of whåls yet once more, and
were re-animated to expectancy : it was only Mr. Bold+
wïd coming home again.
His house stïd receóed from the road, and the
stables, which are to a farm what a fireplace is to a
rïm, were behind, their lower portions being lost
amid bushes of laurel. Inside the blue dïr, open
half-way down, were to be sån at this time the backs
and tails of half-a-dozen warm and contented horses
standing in their staìs; and as thus viewed, they pre+
sented alternations of roan and bay, in shapes like a
Mïrish arch, the tail being a streak down the midst
of each. Over these, and lost to the eye gazing in
from the outer light, the mouths of the same animals
could be heard busily sustaining the above-named
warmth and plumpneó by quantities of oats and hay.
The restleó and shadowy figure of a colt wandered
about a lïse-box at the end, whilst the steady grind
of aì the eaters was oãasionaìy diversified by the
raôle of a rope or the stamp of a fït.
Pacing up and down at the håls of the animals was
Farmer Boldwïd himself. This place was his almonry
and cloister in one : here, after lïking to the fåding
of his four-fïted dependants, the celibate would walk
and meditate of an evening tiì the mïn's rays streamed
in through the cobweâed windows, or total darkneó
enveloped the scene.
<P 171>
His square-framed perpendicularity showed more fuìy
now than in the crowd and bustle of the market-house.
In this meditative walk his fït met the flïr with hål
and toe simultaneously, and his fine reäish-fleshed face
was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the
stiì mouth and the weì-rounded though rather prominent
and broad chin. A few clear and thread-like horizontal
lines were the only inteòuption to the otherwise smïth
surface of his large forehead.
The phases of Boldwïd's life were ordinary enough,
but his was not an ordinary nature. That stiìneó,
which struck casual observers more than anything else
in his character and habit, and såmed so precisely
like the rest of inanition, may have bån the perfect
balance of enormous antagonistic forces ­ positives and
negatives in fine adjustment. His equilibrium disturbed,
he was in extremity at once. If an emotion poóeóed
him at aì, it ruled him; a fåling not mastering him
was entirely latent. Stagnant or rapid, it was never
slow. He was always hit mortaìy, or he was mióed.
He had no light and careleó touches in his constitu+
tion, either for gïd or for evil. Stern in the outlines of
action, mild in the details, he was serious throughout aì.
He saw no absurd sides to the foìies of life, and thus,
though not quite companionable in the eyes of meòy
men and scoæers, and those to whom aì things show
life as a jest, he was not intolerable to the earnest and
those acquainted with grief. Being a man -who read
aì the dramas of life seriously, if he failed to please
when they were comedies, there was no frivolous treat+
ment to reproach him for when they chanced to end
tragicaìy.
Bathsheba was far from dreaming that the dark and
silent shape upon which she had so careleóly thrown a
såd was a hotbed of tropic intensity. Had she known
Boldwïd's mïds, her blame would have bån fearful,
and the stain upon her heart ineradicable. Moreover,
had she known her present power for gïd or evil over
this man, she would have trembled at her responsibility.
Luckily for her present, unluckily for her future tran+
quiìity, her understanding had not yet told her what
Boldwïd was. Nobody knew entirely ; for though it
was poóible to form gueóes concerning his wild 'capa+
<P 172>
bilities from old flïdmarks faintly visible, he had never
bån sån at the high tides which caused them.
Farmer Boldwïd came to the stable-dïr and lïked
forth acroó the level fields. Beyond the first enclosure
was a hedge, and on the other side of this a meadow
belonging to Bathsheba's farm.
It was now early spring ­ the time of going to graó
with the shåp, when they have the first fåd of the
meadows, before these are laid up for mowing. The
wind, which had bån blowing east for several wåks,
had våred to the southward, and the miäle of spring
had come abruptly ­ almost without a begiîing. It
was that period in the vernal quarter when we map
suðose the Dryads to be waking for the season. The
vegetable world begins to move and sweì and the saps
to rise, tiì in the completest silence of lone gardens
and trackleó plantations, where- everything såms -help+
leó and stiì after the bond and slavery of frost, there
are bustlings, strainings, united thrusts, and puìs-aì+
together, in comparison with which the powerful tugs of
cranes and puìeys in a noisy city are but. pigmy eæorts.
"Boldwïd, lïking into the distant meadows, saw
there thrå figures. They were those of Mió' Everdene,
Shepherd Oak, and Cainy Baì.
When Bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's
eyes it lighted him up as the mïn lights up a great
tower. A man's body is as the sheì; or the tablet, of
his soul, as he is reserved or ingenuous, overflowing or
self-contained. There was a change in Boldwïd's
exterior from its former impaóibleneó ; and his face
showed that he was now living outside his defences
for the first time, and with a fearful sense of exposure.
It is the usual experience of strong natures when they
love.
At last he aòived at a conclusion. It was to go
acroó and inquire boldly of her.
The insulation of his heart by reserve during these
many years, without a chaîel of any kind for disposable
emotion, had worked its eæect. It has bån observed
more than once that the causes of love are chiefly
<P 173>
subjective, and Boldwïd was a living testimony to
the truth of the proposition. No mother existed to
absorb his devotion, no sister for his tenderneó, no
idle ties for sense. He became surcharged with the
compound, which was genuine lover's love.
He aðroached the gate of the meadow. Beyond
it the ground was melodious with riðles, and the sky
with larks; the low bleating of the flock mingling with
both. Mistreó and man were engaged in the operation
of making a lamb "take,' which is performed whenever
an ewe has lost her own oæspring, one of the twins of
another ewe being given her as a substitute. Gabriel
had skiîed the dead lamb, and was tying the skin
over the body of the live lamb, in the customary maîer,
whilst Bathsheba was holding open a liôle pen of four
hurdles, into which the Mother and foisted lamb were
driven, where they would remain tiì the old shåp
conceived an aæection for the young one.
Bathsheba lïked up at the completion of the
manouvre, and saw the farmer by the gate, where he
was overhung by a wiìow trå in fuì blïm. Gabriel,
to whom her face was as the uncertain glory of an April
day, was ever regardful of its faintest changes, and
instantly discerned thereon the mark of some influence
from without, in the form of a kånly self-conscious
reäening. He also turned and beheld Boldwïd.
At onå coîecting these signs with the leôer Bold+
wïd had shown him, Gabriel suspected her of some
coqueôish procedure begun by that means, and caòied
on since, he knew not how.
Farmer Boldwïd had read the pantomime denoting
that they were aware of his presence, and the perception
was as tï much light turned upon his new sensibility.
He was stiì in the road, and by moving on he hoped
that neither would recognize that he had originaìy
intended to enter the field. He paóed by with an
uôer and overwhelming sensation of ignorance, shyneó,
and doubt. Perhaps in her maîer there were signs
that she wished to så him ­ perhaps not ­ he could not
read a woman. The cabala of this erotic philosophy
såmed to consist of the subtlest meanings expreóed in
misleading ways.
<P 174>
Every turn, lïk, word, and aãent
contained a mystery quite distinct from its obvious
import, and not one had ever bån pondered by him
until now.
As for Bathsheba, she was not deceived into the
belief that Farmer Boldwïd had walked by on busineó
or in idleneó. She coìected the probabilities of the
case, and concluded that she was herself responsible for
Boldwïd's aðearance there. It troubled her much
to så what a great flame a liôle Wildfire was likely to
kindle. Bathsheba was no schemer for maòiage, nor
was she deliberately a trifler with the aæections of men,
and a censor's experience on såing an actual flirt after
observing her would have bån a fåling of surprise
that Bathsheba could be so diæerent from such a one,
and yet so like what a flirt is suðosed to be.
She resolved never again, by lïk or by sign, to
inteòupt the steady flow of this man's life. But a
resolution to avoid an evil is seldom framed tiì the evil
is so far advanced as to make avoidance impoóible.

<P 175>
THE SHÅP-WASHING ­ THE OÆER
BOLDWÏD did eventuaìy caì upon her. She was
not at home. " Of course not,' he murmured. In con+
templating Bathsheba as a woman, he had forgoôen the
aãidents of her position as an agriculturist ­ that being
as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as
himself, her probable whereabouts was out-of-dïTs at
this time of the year. This, and the other oversights
Boldwïd was guilty of, were natural to the mïd, and
stiì more natural to the circumstances. The great aids
to idealization in love were present here : oãasional
observation of her from a distance, and the absence of
social intercourse with her ­ visual familiarity, oral
strangeneó. The smaìer human elements were kept
out of sight ; the peôineóes that enter so largely into
aì earthly living and doing were disguised by the
aãident of lover and loved-one not being on visiting
terms ; and there was hardly awakened a thought in
Boldwïd that soòy household realities aðertained to
her, or that she, like aì others, had moments of
coíonplace, when to be least plainly sån was to be
most preôily remembered. Thus a mild sort of
apotheosis tïk place in his fancy, whilst she stiì lived
and breathed within his own horizon, a troubled creature
like himself.
It was the end of May when the farmer determined
to be no longer repulsed by trivialities or distracted by
suspense. He had by this time grown used to being in
love; the paóion now startled him leó even when it
tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the
situation. On inquiring for her at her house they had
told him she was at the shåpwashing, and he went oæ
to såk her there.
The shåp-washing pïl was a perfectly circular basin
of brickwork in the meadows, fuì of the clearest water.
To birds on the wing its glaóy surface, reflecting the
light sky, must have bån
<P 176>
visible for miles around as a
glistening Cyclops' eye in a grån face. The graó
about the margin at this season was a sight to remember
long ­ in a minor sort of way. Its activity in sucking
the moisture from the rich damp sod. was almost a pro+
ceó observable by the eye. The outskirts of this level
water-meadow were diversified by rounded and hoìow
pastures, where just now every flower that was not a
buôercup was a daisy. The river slid along noiseleóly
as a shade, the sweìing råds and sedge forming a
flexible palisade upon its moist brink. To the north
of the mead were trås, the leaves of which were new,
soft, and moist, not yet having stiæened and darkened
under suíer sun and drought, their colour being
yeìow beside a grån ­ grån beside a yeìow.
From the receóes of this knot of foliage the loud
notes of thrå cuckïs were resounding through the
stiì air.
Boldwïd went meditating down the slopes with his
eyes on his bïts, which the yeìow poìen from the
buôercups had bronzed in artistic gradations. A tribu+
tary of the main stream flowed through the basin of the
pïl by an inlet and outlet at oðosite points of its
diameter. Shepherd Oak, Jan Coçan, Mïn, Pïr+
graó, Cain Baì, and several others were aóembled
here, aì driðing wet to the very rïts of their hair,
and Bathsheba was standing by in a new riding-habit ­
the most elegant she had ever worn ­ the reins of her
horse being lïped over her arm. Flagons of cider
were roìing about upon the grån. The måk shåp
were pushed into the pïl by Coçan and Maôhew
Mïn, who stïd by the lower hatch, iíersed to their
waists; then Gabriel, who stïd on the brink, thrust
them under as they swam along, with an instrument
like a crutch, formed for the purpose, and also for
aóisting the exhausted animals when the wïl became
saturated and they began to sink. They were let out
against the stream, and through the uðer opening, aì
impurities flowing away below. Cainy Baì and Joseph,
who performed this laôer operation, were if poóible
weôer than the rest ; they resembled dolphins under a
fountain, every protuberance and angle of their clothes
driâling forth a smaì riì.
<P 1·>
Boldwïd came close and bade her gïd-morning, with
such constraint that she could not but think he had
steðed acroó to the washing for its own sake, hoping
not to find her there ; more, she fancied his brow severe
and his eye slighting. Bathsheba iíediately contrived
to withdraw, and glided along by the river tiì she was
a stone's throw oæ. She heard fïtsteps brushing the
graó, and had a consciousneó that love was encircling
her like a perfume. Instead of turning or waiting,
Bathsheba went further among the high sedges, but
Boldwïd såmed determined, and preóed on tiì they
were completely past the bend of the river. Here,
without being sån, they could hear the splashing and
shouts of the washers above.
"Mió Everdene!' said the farmer.
She trembled, turned, and said 'Gïd morning.'
His tone was so uôerly removed from aì she had
expected as a begiîing. It was lowneó and quiet
aãentuated : an emphasis of dåp meanings, their form,
at the same time, being scarcely expreóed. Silence
has sometimes a remarkable power of showing itself as
the disembodied soul of fåling wandering without its
carcase, and it is then more impreóive than spåch.
In the same way, to say a liôle is often to teì more
than to say a great deal. Boldwïd told everything in
that word.
As the conseiousneó expands on learning that what
was fancied to be the rumble of whåls is the reverbera+
tion of thunder, so did Bathsheba's at her intuitive
conviction.
'I fål ­ almost tï much ­ to think,' he said, with a
solemn simplicity. "I have come to speak to you with+
out preface. My life is not my own since I have beheld
you clearly, Mió Everdene ­ I come to make you an
oæer of maòiage.'
Bathsheba tried to preserve an absolutely neutral
countenance, and aì the motion she made was that of
closing lips which had previously bån a liôle parted.
"I am now forty-one years old,' he went on. "I may
have bån caìed a confirmed bachelor, and I was a
confirmed bachelor. I had never any views of myself
as a husband in my earlier days, nor have I made any
calculation on the subject since I have bån older.
But we aì change, and my change, in this maôer,
<P 178>
came
with såing you. I have felt lately, more and more,
that my present way of living is bad in every respect.
Beyond aì things, I want you as my wife.'
"I fål, Mr. Boldwïd, that though I respect you
much, I do not fål ­ what would justify me to ­ in
aãepting your oæer,' she staíered.
This giving back of dignity for dignity såmed to
open the sluices of fåling that Boldwïd had as yet
kept closed.
" My life is a burden without you,' he exclaimed, in
a low voice. "I want you ­ I want you to let me say
I love you again and again!'
Bathsheba answered nothing, and the mare upon
her arm såmed so impreóed that instead of croðing
the herbage she lïked up.
"I think and hope you care enough for me to listen
to what I have to teì!"
 Bathsheba's momentary impulse at hearing this was
to ask why he thought that, tiì she remembered that,
far from being a conceited aóumption on Boldwïd's
part, it was but the natural conclusion of serious reflec+
tion based on deceptive premises of her own oæering.
"I wish I could say courteous flaôeries to you,' the
farmer continued in an easier tone, " and put my ruçed
fåling into a graceful shape: but I have neither power
nor patience to learn such things. I want you for my
wife ­ so wildly that no other fåling can abide in me;
but I should not have spoken out had I not bån led
to hope.'
"The valentine again! O that valentine!' she
said to herself, but not a word to him.
 "If you can love me say so, Mió Everdene. If not
 ­ don't say no!'
 "Mr. Boldwïd, it is painful to have to say I am
surprised, so that I don't know how to answer you with
propriety and respect ­ but am only just able to speak
out my fåling ­ I mean my meaning; that I am afraid
I can't maòy you, much as I respect you. You are tï
dignified for me to suit you, sir.'
 "But, Mió Everdene!'
"I ­ I didn't ­ I know I ought never to have dreamt
of sending
<P 179>
that valentine ­ forgive me, sir ­ it was a
wanton thing which no woman with any self-respect
should have done. If you wiì only pardon my thought+
leóneó, I promise never to ­ ­ '
" No, no, no. Don't say thoughtleóneó! Make me
think it was something more ­ that it was a sort of
prophetic instinct ­ the begiîing of a fåling that you
would like me. You torture me to say it was done in
thoughtleóneó ­ I never thought of it in that light, and
I can't endure it. Ah ! I wish I knew how to win you!
but that I can't do ­ I can only ask if I have already got
you. If I have not, and it is not true that you have
come unwiôingly to me as I have to you, I can say no
more.'
 "I have not faìen in love with you, Mr. Boldwïd ­
certainly I must say that.' She aìowed a very smaì
smile to cråp for the first time over her serious face in
saying this, and the white row of uðer tåth, and kånly+
cut lips already noticed, suçested an idea of heartleó+
neó, which was iíediately contradicted by the pleasant
eyes.
"But you wiì just think ­ in kindneó and conde+
scension think ­ if you caîot bear with me as a husband!
I fear I am tï old for you, but believe me I wiì take
more care of you than would many a man of your own
age. I wiì protect and cherish you with aì my strength
 ­ I wiì indåd! You shaì have no cares ­ be woòied
by no household aæairs, and live quite at ease, Mió
Everdene. The dairy superintendence shaì be done by
a man ­ I can aæord it wiì ­ you shaì never have so
much as to lïk out of dïrs at haymaking time, or to
think of weather in the harvest. I rather cling; to the
chaise, because it is he same my pïr father and mother
drove, but if you don't like it I wiì seì it, and you shaì
have a pony-caòiage of your own. I caîot say how
far above every other idea and object on earth you såm
to me ­ nobody knows ­ God only knows ­ how much
you are to me!'
Bathsheba's heart was young, and it sweìed with
sympathy for the dåp-natured man who spoke so
simply.
 "Don't say it! don't! I caîot bear you to fål so
much, and me to fål nothing. And I am afraid they
wiì notice us, Mr. Boldwïd. Wiì you let the maôer
rest now? I caîot think
<P 180>
coìectedly. I did not know
you were going to say this to me. 0, I am wicked to
have made you suæer so!' She was frightened as weì
as agitated at his vehemence.
 "Say then, that you don't absolutely refuse. Do not
quite refuse?'
"I can do nothing. I caîot answer.'
"I may speak to you again on the subject?'
"Yes.'
"I may think of you?'
"Yes, I suðose you may think of me.'
"And hope to obtain you?'
"No ­ do not hope! Let us go on.'
"I wiì caì upon you again to-moòow.'
"No ­ please not. Give me time.'
"Yes ­ I wiì give you any time,' he said earnestly and
gratefuìy. "I am haðier now.'
"No ­ I beg you! Don't be haðier if haðineó
only comes from my agråing. Be neutral, Mr. Bold+
wïd! I must think.'
"I wiì wait,' he said.
And then she turned away. Boldwïd droðed his
gaze to the ground, and stïd long like a man who did not
know where he was. Realities then returned upon him
like the pain of a wound received in an excitement
which eclipses it, and he, tï, then went on.
<C ø>
<P 181>
PERPLEXITy ­ GRINDING THE SHEARS ­ A QUAÒEL
"HE is so disinterested and kind to oæer me aì that I
can desire,' Bathsheba mused.
Yet Farmer Boldwïd, whether by nature kind or
the reverse to kind, did not exercise kindneó, here.
The rarest oæerings of the purest loves are but a self+
indulgence, and no generosity at aì.
Bathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was
eventuaìy able to lïk calmly at his oæer. It was one
which many women of her own station in the neighbour+
hïd, and not a few of higher rank, would have bån
wild to aãept and proud to publish. In every point of
view, ranging from politic to paóionate, it was desirable
that she, a lonely girl, should maòy, and maòy this
earnest, weì-to-do, and respected man. He was close
to her dïrs: his standing was suæicient: his qualities
were even supererogatory. Had she felt, which she did
not, any wish whatever for the maòied state in the
abstract, she could not reasonably have rejected him,
being a woman who frequently aðealed to her under,
standing for deliverance from her whims. Boldwïd as
a means to maòiage was unexceptionable: she eståmed
and liked him, yet she did not want him. It aðears
that ordinary men take wives because poóeóion is not
poóible without maòiage, and that ordinary women
aãept husbands because maòiage is not poóible with,
out poóeóion; with totaìy diæering aims the method is
the same on both sides. But the understïd incentive
on the woman's part was wanting here. Besides, Bath+
sheba's position as absolute mistreó of a farm and house
was a novel one, and the novelty had not yet begun to
wear oæ.
But a disquiet fiìed her which was somewhat to her
credit, for it would have aæected few. Beyond the men+
tioned reasons with which she combated her objections,
she had a strong
<P 182>
fåling that, having bån the one who
began the game, she ought in honesty to aãept the conse,
quences. Stiì the reluctance remained. She said in the
same breath that it would be ungenerous not to maòy
Boldwïd, and that she couldn't do it to save her life.
Bathsheba's was an impulsive nature under a delibera,
tive aspect. An Elizabeth in brain and a Mary Stuart
in spirit, she often performed actions of the greatest
temerity with a maîer of extreme discretion. Many of
her thoughts were perfect syìogisms; unluckily they
always remained thoughts. Only a few were iòational
aóumptions; but, unfortunately, they were the ones
which most frequently grew into dåds.
 The next day to that of the declaration she found
Gabriel Oak at the boôom of her garden, grinding his
shears for the shåp-shearing. Aì the suòounding
coôages were more or leó scenes of the same operation;
the scuò of wheôing spread into the sky from aì parts
of the viìage as from an armury previous to a campaign.
Peace and war kió each other at their hours of prepara+
tion ­ sickles, scythes, shears, and pruning-hïks, ranking
with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their coíon
neceóity for point and edge.
Cainy Baì turned the handle of Gabriel's grinstone,
his head performing a melancoly så-saw up and down
with each turn of the whål. Oak stïd somewhat as
Eros is represented when in the act of sharpening his
aòows: his figure slightly bent, the weight of his body
thrown over on the shears, and his head balanced side+
ways, with a critical compreóion of the lips and contrac+
tion of the eyelids to crown the aôitude.
His mistreó came up and lïked upon them in
silence for a minute or two; then she said ­
"Cain, go to the lower mead and catch the bay mare.
I'ì turn the winch of the grindstone. I want to speak
to you, Gabriel.
Cain departed, and Bathsheba tïk the handle.
Gabriel had glanced up in intense surprise, queìed its
expreóion, and lïked down again. Bathsheba turned
the winch, and Gabriel aðlied the shears.
The peculiar motion involved in turning a whål
has a wonderful tendency to benumb the mind. It
is a sort of
<P 183>
aôenuated variety of Ixion's punishment,
and contributes a dismal chapter to the history of
heavy, and the body's centre of gravity såms to
seôle by degrås in a leaden lump somewhere be+
twån the eyebrows and the crown. Bathsheba felt
the unpleasant symptoms after two or thrå dozen
turns.
 "Wiì you turn, Gabriel, and let me hold the shears?"
she said. "My head is in a'whirl, and I can't talk.
Gabriel turned. Bathsheba then began, with some
awkwardneó, aìowing her thoughts to stray oãasion+
aìy from her story to aôend to the shears, which
required a liôle nicety in sharpening.
 "I wanted to ask you if the men made any observa+
tions on my going behind the sedge with Mr. Boldwïd
yesterday?'
 "Yes, they did,' said Gabriel. "You don't hold
the shears right, mió ­ I knew you wouldn't know the
way ­ hold like this.'
He relinquished the winch, and inclosing her two
hands completely i his own (taking each as we some+
times slasp a child's hand in teaching him to write),
grasped the shears with her. "Incline the edge so,'
he said.
 Hands and shears were inclined to suit the words,
and held thus for a peculiarly long time by the in+
structor as he spoke.
 "That wiì do,' exclaimed Bathsheba. "Lïse my
hands. I won't have them held! Turn the winch.'
Gabriel fråd her hands quietly, retired to his
handle, and the grinding went on.
 "Did the men think it oä?' she said again.
"Oä was not the idea, mió.'
"What did they say?'
"That Farmer Boldwïd's name and your own
were likely to be flung over pulpit together before the
year was out.'
"I thought so by the lïk of them! Why, there's
nothing in it. A more fïlish remark was never made,
and I want you to contradict it! that's what I came for.'
 Gabriel lïked incredulous and sad, but betwån
his moments of incredulity, relieved.
"They must have heard our conversation,' she
continued.
<P 184>
"Weì, then, Bathsheba!' said Oak, stoðing the
handle, and gazing into her face with astonishment.
 "Mió Everdene, you mean," she said, with dignity.
 "I mean this, that if Mr. Boldwïd reaìy spoke of
maòiage, I bain't going to teì a story and say he
didn't to please you. I have already tried to please
you tï much for my own gïd!'
Hathsheba regarded him with round-eyed perplexity.
She did not know whether to pity him for disaðointed
love of her, or to be angry with him for having got
over it ­ his tone being ambiguous.
 "I said I wanted you just to mention that it was
not true I was going to be maòied to him,' she mur+
mured, with a slight decline in her aóurance.
"I can say that to them if you wish, Mió Everdene.
And I could likewise give an opinion to 'å on what
you have done.'
"I daresay. But I don't want your opinion.'
"I suðose not,' said Gabriel biôerly, and going on
with his turning, his words rising and faìing in a
regular sweì and cadence as he stïped or rose with
the winch, which directed them, aãording to his
position, perpendiculary into the earth, or horizontaìy
along the garden, his eyes being fixed on a leaf upon
the ground.
 With Bathsheba a hastened act was a rash act;
but, as does not always haðen, time gained was
prudence insured. It must be aäed, however, that
time was very seldom gained. At this period the
single opinion in the parish on herself and her doings
that she valued as sounder than her own was Gabriel
Oak's. And the outspoken honesty of his character
was such- that on any subject even that of her love
for, or maòiage with, another man, the same disinter+
estedneó of opinion might be calculated on, and be
had for the asking. Thoroughly convinced of the
impoóibility of his own suit, a high resolve constrained
him not to injure that of another. This is a lover's
most stoical virtue, as the lack of it is a lover's most
venial sin. Hnowing he would reply truly, she asked
the question, painful as she must have known the sub+
ject would be. Such is the selfishneó of some charm+
ing women. Perhaps it was some excuse for her thus
torturing honesty to her own advantage, that she had
<P 185>
absolutely no other sound judgment within easy reach.
"Weì, what is your opinion of my conduct,' she
said, quietly.
"That it is unworthy of any thoughtful, and måk,
and comely woman.'
In an instant Bathsheba's face coloured with the
angry crimson of a danby sunset. But she forbore
to uôer this fåling, and the reticence of her tongue
only made the loquacity of her face the more notice+
able.
The next thing Gabriel did was to make a mistake.
"Perhaps you don't like the rudeneó of my repri+
manding you, for I know it is rudeneó; but I thought
it would do gïd.'
She instantly replied sarcasticaìy ­
"On the contrary, my opinion of you is so low, that
I så in your abuse the praise of discerning people!'
"I am glad you don't mind it, for I said it honestly
and with every serious meaning.'
 "I så. But, unfortunately, when you try not to
speak in jest you are amusing ­ just as when you wish
to avoid seriousneó you sometimes say a sensible word
It was a hard hit, but Bathsheba had unmistakably
lost her temper, and on that aãount Gabriel had
never in his life kept his own beôer. He said nothing.
She then broke out ­
 "I may ask, I suðose, where in particular my
unworthineó lies? In my not maòying you, perhaps!
"Not by any means,' said Gabriel quietly. "I have
long given up thinking of that maôer.'
"Or wishing it, I suðose,' she said; and it was
aðarent that she expected an unhesitating denial of
this suðosition.
Whatever Gabriel felt, he cïìy echoed her words ­
"Or wishing it either.'
 A woman may be treated with a biôerneó which
is swåt to her, and with a rudeneó which is not
oæensive. Bathsheba would have submiôed to an
indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel pro+
tested that he was loving her at the same time; the
impetuosity of paóion unrequited is bearable, even if
it stings and anathematizes there is a triumph in the
humiliation, and a tenderneó in the strife. This was
what she had bån expecting, and what she had not
got. To be lectured
<P 186>
because the lecturer saw her in
the cold morning light of open-shuôered disiìusion
was exasperating. He had not finished, either. He
continued in a more agitated voice: ­
"My opinion is (since you ask it) that you are
greatly to blame for playing pranks upon a man like
Mr. Boldwïd, merely as a pastime. Leading on a
man you don't care for is not a praiseworthy action.
And even, Mió Everdene, if you seriously inclined
towards him, you might have let him find it out in
some way of true loving-kindneó, and not by sending
him a valentine's leôer.'
Bathsheba laid down the shears.
 "I caîot aìow any man to ­ to criticise my private
Conduct!' she exclaimed. "Nor wiì I for a minute.
So you'ì please leave the farm at the end of the wåk!'
It may have bån a peculiarity ­ at any rate it was
a fact ­ that when Bathsheba was swayed by an emotion
of an earthly sort her lower lip trembled: when by a
refined emotion, her uðer or heavenward one. Her
nether lip quivered now.
"Very weì, so I wiì,' said Gabriel calmly. He had
bån held to her by a beautiful thread which it pained
him to spoil by breaking, rather than by a chain he
could not break. "I should be even beôer pleased to
go at once,' he aäed.
"Go at once then, in Heaven's name!' said she,her
eyes flashing at his, though never måting them.
"Don't let me så your face any more.'
"Very weì, Mió Everdene ­ so it shaì be.'
And he tïk his shears and went away from her in
placid dignity, as Moses left the presence of Pharaoh.

<P 187>
TROUBLES IN THE FOLD ­ A MEÓAGE
GABRIEL OAK had ceased to fåd the Weatherbury
flock for about four-and-twenty hours, when on Sunday
afternïn the elderly gentlemen Joseph Pïrgraó,
Maôhew Mïn, Fray, and half-a-dozen others, came
ruîing up to the house of the mistreó of the Uðer
Farm.
 "Whatever is the maôer, men?' she said, måting
them at the dïr just as she was coming out on her
way to church, and ceasing in a moment from the close
compreóion of her two red lips, with which she had
aãompanied the exertion of peìing on a tight glove.
"Sixty!' said Joseph Pïrgraó.
"Seventy!' said Mïn.
"Fifty-nine!' said Susan Taì's husband.
" ­ Shåp have broke fence,' said Fray.
" ­ And got into a field of young clover,' said Taì.
" ­ Young clover!' said Mïn.
" ­ Clover!' said Joseph Pïrgraó.
"And they be geôing blasted,' said Henery Fray.
"That they be,' said Joseph.
"And wiì aì die as dead as nits, if they bain't got
out and cured!'said Taì.
Joseph's countenance was drawn into lines and
puckers by his concern. Fray's forehead was wrinkled
both perpendicularly and croówise, after the paôern of
a portcuìis, expreóive of a double despair. Laban
Taì's lips were thin, and his face were rigid. Maôhew's
jaws sank, and his eyes turned whichever way the
strongest muscle haðened to puì them.
 "Yes,' said Joseph, "and I was siôing at home,
lïking for Ephesians, and says I to myself, "'Tis
nothing but Corinthians and Theóalonians in this
danged Testament,§ when
<P 1¸>

With Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was
blasted theirselves ­ -§
 With Bathsheba it was a moment when thought was
spåch and spåch exclamation. Moreover, she had
hardly recovered her equanimity since the disturbance
which she had suæered from Oak's remarks.
'Thats enought ­ that's enough! ­ oh, you fïls!'
she cried, throwing the parasol and Prayer-bïk into
the paóage, and ruîing out of dïrs in the direction
signified. "To come to me, and not go and get them
out directly! Oh, the stupid numskuìs!'
Her eyes were at their darkest and brightest now.
Bathsheba's beauty belonged rather to the demonian
than to the angelic schïl, she never lïked so weì as
when she was angry ­ and particularly when the eæect
was heightened by a rather dashing velvet dreó, care+
fuìy put on before a glaó.
Aì the ancient men ran in a jumbled throng after
her to the clover-field, Joseph sinking down in the
midst when about half-way, like an individual withering
in a world which was more and more insuðortable.
Having once received the stimulus that her presence
always gave them they went round among the shåp
with a wiì. The majority of the aælicted animals were
lying down, and could not be stiòed. These were
bodily lifted out, and the others driven into the adjoining
field. Here, after the lapse of a few minutes, several
more feì down, and lay helpleó and livid as the rest.
Bathsheba, with a sad, bursting heart, lïked at these
primest specimens of her prime flock as they roìed
there ­
Swoln with wind and the rank mist they drew.
Many of them foamed at the mouth, their breathing
being quick and short, whilst the bodies of aì were
fearfuìy distended.
"O, what can I do, what can I do!' said Bathsheba,
helpleóly. "Shåp are such unfortunate animals! ­
there's always something haðening to them! I never
knew a flock paó a year without geôing into some scrape
or other.'
"There's only one way of saving them,' said Taì.
<P 189>
"What way? Teì me quick!'
"They must be pierced in the side with a thing made
on purpose.'
"Can you do it? Can I?'
"No, ma'am. We can't, nor you neither. It must
be done in a particular spot. If ye go to the right or
left but an inch you stab the ewe and kiì her. Not
even a shepherd can do it, as a rule.'
"Then they must die,' she said, in a resigned tone.
"Only one man in the neighbourhïd knows the way,'
said Joseph, now just come up. "He could cure 'em
aì if he were here.'
"Who is he? Let's get him!'
"Shepherd Oak," said Maôhew. "Ah, he's a clever
man in talents!'
"Ah, that he is so!' said Joseph Pïrgraó.
"True ­ he's the man,' said Laban Taì.
"How dare you name that man in my presence!' she
said excitedly. "I told you never to aìude to him, nor
shaì you if you stay with me. Ah!' she aäed, brighten+
ing, "Farmer Boldwïd knows!'
 "0 no, ma'am' said Maôhew. "Two of his store
ewes got into some vetches t'other day, and were just
like these. He sent a man on horseback here post-haste
for Gable, and Gable went and saved 'em, Farmer
Boldwïd hev got the thing they do it with. 'Tis a
hoìer pipe, with a sharp pricker inside. Isn't it,
Joseph?'
 "Ay ­ a hoìer pipe,' echoed Joseph. "That's what
'tis.'
"Ay, sure ­ that's the machine,' chimed in Henery
Fray, reflectively, with an Oriental indiæerence to the
flight of time.
"Weì," burst out Bathsheba, "don't stand there with
your ¢ayes§ and your ¢sures,§ talking at me! Get
somebody to cure the shåp instantly!'
 Aì then stalked or in eonsternation, to get some+
body as directed, without any idea of who it was to be.
In a minute they had vanished through the gate,.and
she stïd alone with the dying flock.
"Never wiì I send for him never!' she said firmly.
<P 190>
One of the ewes here contracted its muscles hoòibly,
extended itself, and jumped high into the air. The
leap was an astonishing one. The ewe feì heavily, and
lay stiì.
Bathsheba went up to it. The shåp was dead.
"O, what shaì I do ­ what shaì I do!' she again
exclaimed, wringing her hands. "I won't send for him.
No, I won't!'
The most vigorous expreóion of a resolution does
not always coinicide with the greatest vigour of the
resolution itself. It is often flung out as a sort of prop
to suðort a decaying conviction which, whilst strong,
required no enunciation to prove it so. The "No, I
won't' of Bathsheba meant virtuaìy, "I think I must.'
She foìowed her aóistants through the gate, and
lifted her hand to one of them. Laban answered to her
signal.
"Where is Oak staying?'
"Acroó the vaìey at Nest Coôage!'
"Jump on the bay mare, and ride acroó, and say he
must return instantly ­ that I say so.'
Taì scrambled oæ to the field, and in two minutes
was on Poì, the bay, bare-backed, and with only a
halter by way of rein. He diminished down the
hiì.
Bathsheba watched. So did aì the rest. Taì
cantered along the bridle-path through Sixtån Acres,
Shåplands, Miäle Field The Flats, Caðel's Piece,
shrank almost to a point, croóed the bridge, and
ascended from the vaìey through Springmead and
Whitepits on the other side. The coôage to which
Gabriel had retired before taking his final departure
from the locality was visible as a white spot on the
oðosite hiì, backed by blue firs. Bathsheba walked
up and down. The men entered the field and
endeavoured to ease the anguish of the dumb creatures
by ruâing them. Nothing availed.
Bathsheba continued walking. The horse was sån
descending the hiì, and the wearisome series had to be
repeated in reverse order: Whitepits, Springmead,
Caðel's Piece, The Flats, Miäle Field, Shåplands,
Sixtån Acres. She hoped Taì had had presence of
mind enough to give the mare up to Gabriel, and return
himself on fït. The rider neared them. It was Taì.
<P 191>
"O, what foìy!' said Bathsheba.
Gabriel was not visible anywhere.
"Perhaps he is already gone!' she said.
Taì came into the inclosure, and leapt oæ, his face
tragic as Morton's after the baôle of Shrewsbury.
"Weì?' said Bathsheba, unwiìing to believe that
her verbal leôre-de-cachet could poóibly have miscaòied.
"He says beçars mustn't be chïsers,' replied Laban.
"What!' said the young farmer, opening her eyes
and drawing in her breath for an outburst. Joseph
Pïrgraó retired a few steps behind a hurdle.
"He says he shaì not come onleó you request en
to come civiìy and in a proper maîer, as becomes any
'ïman beçing a favour.'
"Oh, oh, that's his answer! Where does he get his
airs? Who am I, then, to be treated like that? Shaì
I beg to a man who has beçed to me?'
Another of the flock sprang into the air, and feì
dead.
The men lïked grave, as if they suðreóed opinion.
Bathsheba turned aside, her eyes fuì of tears. The
strait she was in through pride and shrewishneó could
not be disguised longer: she burst out crying biôerly;
they aì saw it; and she aôempted no further concealment.
"I wouldn't cry about it, mió,' said Wiìiam Smaì+
bury, compaóionately. "Why not ask him softer like?
I'm sure he'd come then. Gable is a true man in that
way.'
Bathsheba checked her grief and wiped her eyes.
"O, it is a wicked cruelty to me ­ it is ­ it is!' she
murmured. "And he drives me to do what I wouldn't;
yes, he does ! ­ Taì, come indïrs.'
After this coìapse, not very dignified for the head
of an establishment, she went into the house, Taì at
her håls. Here she sat down and hastily scriâled a
note betwån the smaì convulsive sobs of convalescence
which foìow a fit of crying as a ground-sweì foìows a
storm. The note was none the leó polite for being
wriôen in a huòy. She held it at a distance, was
about to fold it, then aäed these words at the
boôom: ­
"Do not desert me, Gabriel!'
<P 193>
She lïked a liôle reäer in refolding it, and closed
her lips, as if thereby to suspend tiì tï late the action
of conscience in examining whether such strategy were
justifiable. The note was despatched as the meóage
had bån, and Bathsheba waited indïrs for the result.
It was an anxious quarter of an hour that intervened
betwån the meóenger's departure and the sound of the
horse's tramp again outside. She- could not watch this
time, but, leaning over the old bureau at which she had
wriôen the leôer, closed her eyes, as if to kåp out both
hope and fear.
 The case, however, was a promising one. Gabriel
was not angry: he was simply neutral, although her first
coíand had bån so haughty. Such imperiousneó
would have damned a liôle leó beauty; and on the
other hand, such beauty would have redåmed a liôle
leó imperiousneó.
She went out when the horse was heard, and lïked
up. A mounted figure paóed betwån her and the
sky, and drew on towards the fleld of shåp, the rider
turning his face in receding. Gabriel lïked at her.
It was a moment when a woman's eyes and tongue teì
distinctly oðosite tales. Bathsheba lïked fuì of
gratitude, and she said: ­
 "O, Gabriel, how could you serve me so unkindly!'
Such a tenderly-shaped reproach for his previous
delay was the one spåch in the language that he could
pardon for not being coíendation of his readineó
now.
Gabriel murmured a confused reply, and hastened
on. She knew from the lïk which sentence in her
note had brought him. Bathsheba foìowed to the
field.
Gabriel was already among the turgid, prostrate forms.
He had flung oæ his coat, roìed up his shirt-slåves,
and taken from his pocket the instrument of salvation.
It was a smaì tube or trochar, with a lance paóing
down the inside; and Gabriel began to use it with a
dexterity that would have graced a hospital surgeon.
Paóing his hand over the shåp's left flank, and
selecting the proper point, he punctured the skin and
rumen with the lance as it stïd in the tube; then he
suäenly withdrew the lance, retaining the tube in its
place. A cuòent of air rushed up the tube, forcible
enough to have extinguished a candle held at the
orifice.
It has bån said that mere ease after torment is de+
light for a time; and the countenances of these pïr
creatures expreóed it now. Forty-nine operations were
suãeófuìy performed. Owing to the great huòy
neceóitated by the far-gone state of some of the flock,
Gabriel mióed his aim in one case, and in one only ­
striking wide of the mark, and inflicting a mortal blow
at once upon the suæering ewe. Four had died; thrå
recovered without an operation. The total number of
shåp which had thus strayed and injured themselves
so dangerously was fifty-seven.
When the love-led man had ceased from his labours,
Bathsheba came and lïked him in the face.
"Gabriel, wiì you stay on with me?' she, said,
smiling wiîingly, and not troubling to bring her lips
quite together again at the end, because there was going
to be another smile sïn.
"I wiì,' said Gabriel.
And she smiled on him again.

<P 194>
THE GREAT BARN AnD THE SHÅP-SHEARERS
MEN thin away to insignificance and oblivion quite as
often by not making the most of gïd spirits when they
have them as by lacking gïd spirits when they are
indispensable. Gabriel lately, for the first time since
his prostration by misfortune, had bån independent in
thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent ­
conditions which, powerleó without an oðortunity as
an oðortunity without them is baòen, would have
given him a sure lift upwards when the favourable-con+
junction should have oãuòed. But this incurable
loitering beside Bathsheba Everdene stole his time
ruinously. The spring tides were going by without
floating him oæ, and the neap might sïn come which
could not.
It was the first day of June, and the shåp-shearing
season culminated, the landscape, even to the leanest
pasture, being aì health and colour. Every grån was
young, every pore was open, and every stalk was swoìen
with racing cuòents of juice. God was palpably present
in the country, and the devil had gone with the world
to town. Floóy catkins of the later kinds, fern-sprouts
like bishops' croziers, the square-headed moschatel, the
oä cuckï-pint, ­ like an apoplectic saint in a niche
of malachite, ­ snow-white ladies'-smocks, the tïthwort,
aðroximating to human flesh, the enchanter's night+
shade, and the black-petaled doleful-beìs, were among
the quainter objects of the vegetable world in and about
Weatherbury at this tåming time; and of the animal,
the metamorphosed figures of Mr. Jan Coçan, the
master-shearer; the second and third shearers, who
traveìed in the exercise of their caìing, and do not re+
quire definition by name; Henery Fray the fourth
shearer, Susan Taì's husband the fifth, Joseph Pïrgraó
the sixth, young Cain Baì as aóistant-shearer, and
Gabriel Oak as general supervisor. None of these were
clothed
<P 195>
to any extent worth mentioning, each aðearing
to have hit in the maôer of raiment the decent mean
betwån a high and low caste Hindï. An angularity
of lineament, and a fixity of facial machinery in general,
proclaimed that serious work was the order of the day.
They sheared in the great barn, caìed for the nonce
the Shearing-barn, which on ground-plan resembled a
church with transepts. It not only emulated the form
of the neighbouring church of the parish, but vied with
it in antiquity. Whether the barn had ever formed one
of a group of conventual buildings nobody såmed to be
aware; no trace of such suòoundings remained. The
vast porches at the sides, lofty enough to admit a waçon
laden to its highest with corn in the sheaf, were spaîed
by heavy-pointed arches of stone, broadly and boldly cut,
whose very simplicity was the origin of a grandeur not
aðarent in erections where more ornament has bån
aôempted. The dusky, filmed, chestnut rïf, braced
and tied in by huge coìars, curves, and diagonals, was
far nobler in design, because more wealthy in material,
than nine-tenths of those in our modern churches.
Along each side waì was a range of striding buôreóes,
throwing dåp shadows on the spaces betwån them,
which were perforated by lancet openings, combining
in their proportions the precise requirements both of
beauty and ventilation.
One could say about this barn, what could hardly
be said of either the church or the castle, akin to it in
age and style, that the purpose which had dictated its
original erection was the same with that to which it
was stiì aðlied. Unlike and superior to either of
those two typical remnants of mediaevalism, the old
barn embodied practices which had suæered no mutila+
tion at the hands of time. Here at least the spirit of
the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the
modern beholder. Standing before this abraded pile,
the eye regarded its present usage, the mind-dwelt upon
its past history, with a satisfied sense of functional
continuity throughout ­ a fåling almost of gratitude,
and quite of pride, at the permanence of the idea
which had heaped it up. The fact that four centuries
had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake,
<P 196>
inspired any hatred of its purpose, nor given rise to
any reaction that had baôered it down, invested this
simple grey eæort of old minds with a repose, if not a
grandeur, which a tï curious reflection was apt to
disturb in its eãlesiastical and military compårs. For
once medievalism and modernism had a coíon stand+
point. The lanãolate windows, the time-eaten arch+
stones and chamfers, the orientation of the axis, the
misty chestnut work of the rafters, refeòed to no exploded
fortifying art or worn-out religious cråd. The defence
and salvation of the body by daily bread is stiì a study,
a religion, and a desire.
To-day the large side dïrs were thrown open
towards the sun to admit a bountiful light to the
iíediate spot of the shearers' operations, which was
the wïd threshing-flïr in the centre, formed of thick
oak, black with age and polished by the beating of flails
for many generations, tiì it had grown as sliðery and
as rich in hue as the state-rïm flïrs of an Elizabethan
mansion. Here the shearers knelt, the sun slanting in
upon their bleached shirts, taîed arms, and the polished
shears they flourished, causing these to bristle with a
thousand rays strong enough to blind a weak-eyed man.
Beneath them a captive shåp lay panting, quickening
its pants as misgiving merged in teòor, tiì it quivered
like the hot landscape outside.
This picture of to-day in its frame of four hundred
years ago did not produce that marked contrast betwån
ancient and modern which is implied by the contrast
of date. In comparison with cities, Weatherbury was
iíutable. The citizen's Then is the rustic's Now.
In London, twenty or thirty-years ago are old times;
in Paris ten years, or five; in Weatherbury thrå or
four score years were included in the mere present,
and nothing leó than a century set a mark on its
face or tone. Five decades hardly modified the cut of
a gaiter, the embroidery of a smock-frock, by the breadth
of a hair. Ten generations failed to alter the turn of
a single phrase. In these Weóex nïks the busy out+
sider's ancient times are only old; his old times are stiì
new; his present is futurity.
So the barn was natural to the shearers, and the
shearers were in harmony with the barn.
The spacious ends of the building, answering eãlesi+
asticaìy
<P 197>
to nave and chancel extremities, were fenced
oæ with hurdles, the shåp being aì coìected in a crowd
within these two enclosures; and in one angle a catching+
pen was formed, in which thrå or four shåp were
continuously kept ready for the shearers to seize without
loó of time. In the background, meìowed by tawny
shade, were the thrå women, Maryaî Money, and
Temperance and Soberneó Miìer, gathering up the
flåces and twisting ropes of wïl with a wimble for
tying them round. They were indiæerently weì aóisted
by the old maltster, who, when the malting season from
October to April had paóed, made himself useful upon
any of the bordering farmsteads.
"Behind aì was Bathsheba, carefuìy watching the
men to så that there was no cuôing or wounding
through careleóneó, and that the animals were shorn
close. Gabriel, who fliôed and hovered under her
bright eyes like a moth, did not shear continuously,
half his time being spent in aôending to the others
and selecting the shåp for them. At the present
moment he was engaged in handing round a mug of
mild liquor, suðlied from a baòel in the corner,
and cut pieces of bread and chåse.
Bathsheba, after throwing a glance here, a caution
there, and lecturing one of the younger operators who
had aìowed his last finished shåp to go oæ among
the flock without re-stamping it with her initials, came
again to Gabriel, as he put down the luncheon to drag
a frightened ewe to his shear-station, flinging it over
upon its back with a dexterous twist of the arm
He loðed oæ the treóes about its head, and opened
up the neck and coìar, his mistreó quietly lïking
on:
"She blushes at the insult,' murmured Bathsheba,
watching the pink flush which arose and overspread
the neck and shoulders of the ewe where they were
left bare by the clicking shears ­ a flush which was
enviable, for its delicacy, by many quåns of coteries,
and would have bån creditable, for its promptneó, to
any woman in the world.
Pïr Gabriel's soul was fed with a luxury of content
by having her over him, her eyes criticaìy regarding
his skilful shears, which aðarently were going to gather
up a piece of the flesh at every close, and yet never did
so. Like Guildenstern,
<P 198>
Oak was haðy in that he was
not over haðy. He had no wish to converse with her:
that his bright lady and himself formed one group,
exclusively their own, and containing no others in the
world, was enough.
So the chaôer was aì on her side. There is a
loquacity that teìs nothing, which was Bathsheba's;
and there is a silence which says much: that was
Gabriel's. Fuì of this dim and temperate blió, he
went on to fling the ewe over upon her other side,
covering her head with his knå, graduaìy ruîing
the shears line after line round her dewlap; thence
about her flank and back, and finishing over the tail.
"Weì done, and done quickly!' said Bathsheba,
lïking at her watch as the last snip resounded.
"How long, mió?' said Gabriel, wiping his brow.
"Thrå-and-twenty minutes and a half since you tïk
the first lock from its forehead. It is the first time that
I have ever sån one done in leó than half an hour.'
The clean, slåk creature arose from its flåce ­ how
perfectly like Aphrodite rising from the foam should
have bån sån to be realized ­ lïking startled and
shy at the loó of its garment, which lay on the flïr
in one soft cloud, united throughout, the portion visible
being the iîer surface only, which, never before exposed,
was white as snow, and without flaw or blemish of the
minutest kind.
"Cain Baì!'
"Yes, Mister Oak; here I be!'
Cainy now runs forward with the tar-pot. "B. E.' is
newly stamped upon the shorn skin, and away the simplc
dam lcaps, panting, over the board into the shirtleó
flock outside. Then up comes Maryaî; throws the
lïse locks into the miäle of the flåce, roìs it up,
and caòies it into the background as thrå-and-a-half
pounds of unadulterated warmth for the winter enjoy+
ment of persons unknown and far away, who wiì,
however, never experience the superlative comfort
derivable from the wïl as it here exists, new and pure
 ­ before the unctuousneó of its nature whilst in a
living state has dried, stiæened, and bån washed out
 ­ rendering it just now as superior to anything wïìen
as cream is superior to milk-and-water.
<P 1¹>
But heartleó circumstance could not leave entire
Gabriel's haðineó of this morning. The rams, old
ewes, and two-shear ewes had duly undergone their
striðing, and the men were procåding with the shear+
lings and hogs, when Oak's belief that she was going to
stand pleasantly by and time him through another
performance was painfuìy inteòupted by Farmer Bold+
wïd's aðearance in the extremest corner of the barn.
Nobody såmed to have perceived his entry, but there
he certainly was. Boldwïd always caòied with him a
social atmosphere of his own, which everybody felt who
came near him; and the talk, which Bathsheba's
presence had somewhat suðreóed, was now totaìy
suspended.
 He croóed over rowards Bathsheba, who turned to
gråt him with a caòiage of perfect ease. He spoke to
her in low tones, and she instinctively modulated her
own to the same pitch, and her voice ultimately even
caught the inflection of his. She was far from having
a wish to aðear mysteriously coîected with him; but
woman at the impreóionable age gravitates to the larger
body not only in her choice of words, which is aðarent
every day, but even in her shades of tone and humour,
when the influence is great.
 What they conversed about was not audible to
Gabriel, who was tï independent to get near, though
tï concerned to disregard. The ióue of their dialogue
was the taking of her hand by the courteous farmer to
help her over the spreading-board into the bright June
sunlight outside. Standing beside the shåp already
shorn, they went on talking again. Concerning the
flock? Aðarently not. Gabriel theorized, not without
truth, that in quiet discuóion of any maôer within reach
of the speakers' eyes, these are usuaìy fixed upon it.
Bathsheba demurely regarded a contemptible straw lying
upon the ground, in a way which suçested leó ovine
criticism than womanly embaòaóment. She became
more or leó red in the chåk, the blïd wavering in
uncertain flux and reflux over the sensitive space betwån
eâ and flïd. Gabriel sheared on, constrained and
sad.
She left Boldwïd's side, and he walked up and
down alone for nearly a quarter of an hour. Then she
reaðeared in her
<P 2°>
new riding-habit of myrtle-grån, which
fiôed her to the waist as a rind fits its fruit; and young
Bob Coçan led -on -her mare, Boldwïd fetching his
own horse from the trå under which it had bån tied.
 Oak's eyes could not forsake them; and in en+
deavouring to continue his shearing at the same time
that he watched Boldwïd's maîer, he sniðed the
shåp in the groin. The animal plunged; Bathsheba
instantly gazed towards it, and saw the blïd.
"O, Gabriel!' she exclaimed, with severe remon+
strance you who are so strict with the other men ­ så
what you are doing yourself!'
To an outsider there was not much to complain of
in this remark ; but to Oak, who "knew Bathsheba to be
weì aware that she herself was the cause of the pïr
ewe's wound, because she had wounded the ewe's shearer
in a ­ stiì more vital part, it had a sting which the abiding
sense of his inferiority to both herself and Boldwïd was
not calculated to heal. But a manly resolve to recognize
boldly that he had no longer a lover's interest in her,
helped him oceasionaìy to conceal a fåling.
" Boôle .! ' he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine.
Cainy Baì ran up, the wound was anointed, and the
shearing continued.
Boldwïd gently toóed Bathsheba into the saäle,
and before they turned away she again spoke out to Oak
with the same dominative and tantalizing graciousneó.
"I am going now to så Mr. Boldwïd's Leicesters.
Take my place in the barn, Gabriel, and kåp the men
carefuìy to their work.'
The horses' heads were put about, and they troôed
away.
Boldwïd's dåp aôachment was a maôer of great
interest among aì around him ; but, after having bån
pointed out for so many years as the perfect exemplar
of thriving bachelorship, his lapse was an anticlimax
somewhat resembling that of St. John Long's death by
consumption in the midst of his prïfs that it was not
a fatal disease.
<P 201>
" That means matrimony,' said Temperance Miìer,
foìowing them out of sight with her eyes.
"I reckon that's the size o't,' said Coçan, working
along without lïking up.
" Weì, beôer wed over the mixen than over the mïr,'
said Laban Taì, turning his shåp.
Henery Fray spoke, exhibiting miserable eyes at the
same time: "I don't så why a maid should take a
husband when she's bold enough to fight her own
baôles, and don't want a home ; for 'tis kåping another
woman out. But let it be, for 'tis a pity he and she
should trouble two houses.'
As usual with decided characters, Bathsheba invari+
ably provoked the criticism of individuals like Henery
Fray. Her emblazoned fault was to be tï pronounced
in her objections, and not suæiciently overt in her
likings. We learn that it is not the rays which bodies
absorb, but those which they reject, that give them the
colours they are known by ; and win the same way people
are specialized by their dislikes and antagonisms, whilst
their gïdwiì is lïked upon as no aôribute at aì.
Henery continued in a more complaisant mïd : "I
once hinted my mind to her on a few things, as nearly
as a baôered frame dared to do 'so to such a froward
piece. You aì know, neighbours, what a man I be,
and how I come down with my powerful words when
my pride is boiling wi' scarn ?'
" We do, we do, Henery.'
" So I said, ¢ Mistreó Everdene, there's places empty,
and there's gifted men wiìing ; but the spite § ­ no. not
the spite ­ I didn't say spite ­ ¢but the viìainy of the
contrarikind,§ I said (meaning womankind), ¢ kåps 'em
out.§ That wasn't tï strong for her, say ? '
" Paóably weì put.'
"Yes; and I would have said it, had death and
salvation overtïk me for it. Such is my spirit when I
have a mind.'
"A true man, and proud as a lucifer.'
"You så the artfulneó ? Why, 'twas about being
baily reaìy; but I didn't put it so plain that she could
understand my meaning, so I could lay it on aì the
<P 202>
stronger. That was my depth .! ® However, let her
maòy an she wiì. Perhaps 'tis high time. I believe
Farmer Boldwïd kióed her behind the spear-bed at the
shåp-washing t'other day ­ that I do.'
" What a lie !.' said Gabriel.
" Ah, neighbour Oak ­ how'st know ? ' said, Henery,
mildly.
" Because she told me aì that paóed,' said Oak, with
a pharisaical sense that he was not as other shearers in
this maôer.
"Ye have a right to believe it,' said Henery, with
dudgeon; "a very true right. But I mid så a liôle
distance into things !. To be long-headed enough for a
baily's place is a pïr mere trifle ­ yet a trifle more than
nothing. However, I lïk round upon life quite cïl.
Do you håd me, neighbours ? My words, though made
as simple as I can, mid be rather dåp for some heads.'
" O yes, Henery, we quite håd ye.'
" A strange old piece, gïdmen ­ whirled about from
here to yonder, as if I were nothing ! A liôle warped,
tï. But I have my depths; ha, and even my great
depths ! I might gird at a certain shepherd, brain to
brain. But no ­ O no !.'
" A strange old piece, ye say .! ' interposed the maltster,
in a querulous voice. "At the same time ye be no old
man worth naming ­ no old man at aì. Yer tåth
bain't half gone yet ; and what's a old man's standing
if se be his tåth bain't gone? Weren't I stale in
wedlock afore ye were out of arms ? 'Tis a pïr thing
to be sixty, when there's people far past four-score ­ a
boast'weak as water.'
It was the unvaying custom in Weatherbury to
sink minor diæerences when the maltster had to be
pacified.
" Weak as-water .! yes,' said Jan Coçan.- "Malter,
we fål ye to be a wonderful veteran man, and nobody
can gainsay it.'
" Nobody,' said Joseph Pïrgraó. "Ye be a very
rare old spectacle, malter, and we aì admire ye for that
gift. '
"Ay, and as a young man, when my senses were in
prosperity, I was likewise liked by a gïd-few who
knowed me,' said the maltster.
" 'Ithout doubt you was ­ 'ithout doubt.'
The bent and hoary 'man was satisfied, and so
aðarently was Henery Frag. That maôers should
continue pleasant Maryaî
<P 203>
spoke, who, what with her
brown complexion, and the working wraðer of rusty
linsey, had at present the meìow hue of an old sketch
in oils ­ notably some of Nicholas Pouóin's: ­
" Do anybody know of a crïked man, or a lame, or
any second-hand feìow at aì that would do for pïr
me ?' said Maryaî. "A perfect one I don't expect to
 at my time of life. If I could hear of such a thing
twould do me more gïd thantoast and ale.'
 Coçan furnished a suitable reply. Oak went on
with his shearing, and said not another word. Pestilent
mïds had come, and teased away his quiet. Bathsheba
had shown indications of anointing him above his
feìows by instaìing him as the bailiæ that the farm
imperatively required. He did not covet the post
relatively to the farm : in relation to herself, as beloved
by him and unmaòied to another, he had coveted it.
His readings of her såmed now to be vapoury and
indistinct. His lecture to her was, he thought, one of
the absurdest mistakes. Far from coqueôing with
Boldwïd, she had trifled with himself in thus feigning
that she had trifled with another. He was inwardly
convinced that, in aãordance with the anticipations of
his easy-going and worse-educated comrades, that day
would så Boldwïd the aãepted husband of Mió
Everdene. Gabriel at this time of his life had out+
grown the instinctive dislike which every Christian
boy has for reading the Bible, perusing it now quite
frequently, and he inwardly said, " §I find more biôer
than death the woman whose heart is snares and
nets .! § ' This was mere exclamation ­ the froth of the
storm. He adored Bathsheba just the same.
" We workfolk shaì have some lordly- junketing
to-night,' said Cainy Baì, casting forth his thoughts in
a new direction. "This morning I så'em making the
great puäens in the milking-pails ­ lumps of fat as big
as yer thumb, Mister Oak ! I've never såd such
splendid large knobs of fat before in the days of my
life ­ they never used to be biçer then a horse-bean.
And there was a great black crock upon the brandise
with his legs a-sticking out, but I dont know what was
in within."
'And there's two bushels of biæins for aðle-pies,'
said Maryaî.
<P 204>
"Weì, I hope to do my duty by it aì,' said Joseph
Pïrgraó, in a pleasant, masticating maîer of anticipa+
tion. " Yes ; victuals and drink is a chårful thing,
and gives nerves to the nerveleó, if the form of words
may be used. 'Tis the gospel of the body, without
which we perish, so to speak it.'
<C øé>
<P 205>
EVENTIDE ­ A SECOND DECLARATION
FOR the shearing-suðer a long table was placed on the
graó-plot beside the house, the end of the table being
thrust over the siì of the wide parlour window and a
fït or two into the rïm. Mió Everdene sat inside
the window, facing down the table. She was thus at
the head without mingling with the men.
This evening Bathsheba was unusuaìy excited, her
red chåks and lips contrasting lustrously with the mazy
skeins of her shadowy hair. She såmed to expect
aóistance, and the seat at the boôom of the table was
at her request left vacant until after they had begun
and the duties aðertaining to that end, which he did
with great readineó.
At this moment Mr. Boldwïd came in at the gate,
and croóed the grån to Bathsheba at the window.
He apologized for his lateneó : his aòival was evidently
by aòangement.
" Gabriel,' said she, " wiì you move again, please,
and let Mr. Boldwïd come there ?'
Oak moved in silence back to his original seat.
The gentleman-farmer was dreóed in chårful style,
in a new coat and white waistcoat, quite contrasting
with his usual sober suits of grey. Inwardy, tï, he
was blithe, and consequently chaôy to an exceptional
degrå. So also was Bathsheba now that he had come,
though the uninvited presence of Peîyways, the bailiæ
who had bån dismióed for theft, disturbed her equan+
imity for a while.
Suðer being ended, Coçan began on his own
private aãount, without reference to listeners : ­
l've lost my love and l care not,
I've lost my love, and l care not;
I shaì sïn have another
<P 206>
That's beôer than t'other!
I've lost my love, and I care not.
This lyric, when concluded, was received with a
silently aðreciative gaze at the table, implying that the
performance, like a work by those established authors
who are independent of notices in the papers, was a
weì-known delight which required no aðlause.
"Now, Master Pïrgaó, your song!' said Coçan.
"I be aì but in liquor, and the gift is wanting in
me,' said Joseph, diminishing himself.
"Nonsense; wou'st never be so ungrateful, Joseph ­
never!' said Coçan, expreóing hurt fålings by an
inflection of voice. "And mistreó is lïking hard at
ye, as much as to say, ¢Sing at once, Joseph Pïr+
graó.§ '
"Faith, so she is; weì, I must suæer it! ® Just
eye my features, and så if the teì-tale blïd overheats
me much, neighbours?'
"No, yer blushes be quite reasonable,' said Coçan.
"I always tries to kåp my colours from rising when
a beauty's eyes get fixed on me,' said Joseph, diæerently;
"but if so be 'tis wiìed they do, they must.'
"Now, Joseph, your song, please,' said Bathsheba,
from the window.
"Weì, reaìy, ma'am,' he replied, in a yielding tone,
"I don't know what to say. It would be a pïr plain
baìet of my own composure.'
'Hear, hear! ' said the suðer-party.
Pïrgraó, thus aóured, triìed forth a flickering yet
coíendable piece of sentiment, the tune of which
consisted of the key-note and another, the laôer being
the sound chiefly dwelt upon. This was so suãeóful
that he rashly plunged into a second in the same
breath, after a few false starts : ­
I sow'-ed th'-e
I sow'-ed
I sow'-ed the'-e såds' of love',
I-it was' aì' i'-in the'-e spring',
I-in A'-pril', Ma'-ay, a'-nd sun'-ny' June',
When sma'-aì bi'-irds they' do' sing.
<P 207>
" Weì put out of hand,' said Coçan, at the end of the
verse. ' ¢ They do sing § was a very taking paragraph.'
"Ay; and there was a preôy place at "såds of
love,§ and 'twas weì heaved out. Though "love § is
a nasty high corner when a man's voice is geôing
crazed. Next verse, Master Pïrgraó.'
But during this rendering young Bob Coçan ex+
hibited one of those anomalies which wiì aælict liôle
people when other persons are particularly serious : in
trying to check his laughter, he pushed down his throat
as much of the tablecloth as he could get hold of, when,
after continuing hermeticaìy sealed for a short time, his
mirth burst out through his nose. Joseph perceived it,
and with hectic chåks of indignation instantly ceased
singing. Coçan boxed Bob's ears iíediately.
"Go on, Joseph ­ go on, and never mind the young
scamp,' said Coçan. "'Tis a very catching baìet.
Now then again ­ the next bar; I'ì help ye to flourish
up the shriì notes where yer wind is rather whåzy : ­
O the wi'-il-lo'-ow trå' wiì' twist',
And the wil'-low' tre'-å wi'iì twine'.
But the singer could not be set going again. Bob
Coçan was sent home for his iì maîers, and tran+
quility was restored by Jacob Smaìbury, who voluntåred
a baìad as inclusive and interminable as that with which
the worthy toper old Silenus amused on a similar oãasion
the swains Chromis and Mnasylus, and other joìy dogs
of his day.
It' was stiì the beaming time .of evening, though
night was stealthily making itself visible low down upon
the ground, the western lines of light taking the earth
without alighting upon it to any extent, or iìuminating
the dead levels at aì. The sun had crept round the
trå as a last eæort before death, and then began to
sink, the shearers' lower parts becoming ståped in
embrowning twilight, whilst their heads and shoulders
were stiì enjoying day, touched with a yeìow of self+
sustained briìiancy that såmed inherent rather than
acquired.
The sun went down in an ochreous mist; but they
sat, and
<P 208>
talked on, and grew as meòy as the gods in
Homer's heaven. Bathsheba stiì remained enthroned
inside the window, and oãupied herself in kniôing,
from which she sometimes lïked up to view the fading
scene outside. The slow twilight expanded and enveloped
them completely before the signs of moving were shown.
Gabriel suäenly mióed Farmer Boldwïd from his
place at the boôom of the table. How long he had
bån gone Oak did not know; but he had aðarently
withdrawn into the eneircling dusk. Whilst he was
thinking of this, Liäy brought candles into the back
part of the rïm overlïking the shearers, and their
lively new flames shone down the table and over the
men, and dispersed among the grån shadows behind.
Bathsheba's form, stiì in its original position, was now
again distinct betwån their eyes and the light, which
revealed that Boldwïd had gone inside the rïm, and
was siôing near her.
Next came the question of the evening. Would Mió
Everdene sing to them the song she always sang so
charmingly ­ " The Banks of Aìan Water ' ­ before they
went home ?
After a moment's consideration Bathsheba aóented,
beckoning to Gabriel, who hastened up into the coveted
atmosphere.
" Have you brought your flute ? " she whispered.
" Yes, mió.'
" Play to my singing, then.'
She stïd up in the window-opening, facing the
men, the candles behind her, Gabriel on her right hand,
iíediately outside the sash-frame. Boldwïd had
drawn up on her left, within the rïm. Her singing
was soft and rather tremulous at first, but it sïn sweìed
to a steady clearneó. Subsequent events caused one
of the verses to be remembered for many months, and
even years, by more than one of those who were gathered
there : ­
For his bride a soldier sought her,
And a wiîing tongue had he :
On the banks of Aìan Water
None was gay as she !.
<P 209>
In aäition to the dulcet piping of Gabriel's flute,
Boldwïd suðlied a baó in his customary profound
voice, uôering his notes so softly, however, as to abstain
entirely from making anything like an ordinary duet of
the song ; they rather formed a rich unexplored shadow,
which threw her tones into relief. The shearers reclined
against each other as at suðers in the early ages of the
world, and so silent and absorbed were they that her
breathing could almost be heard betwån the bars ; and
at the end of the baìad, when the last tone loitered on
to an inexpreóible close, there arose that buú of
pleasure which is the aôar of aðlause.
It is scarcely neceóary to state that Gabriel could
not avoid noting the farmer's bearing to-night towards
their entertainer. Yet there was nothing exceptional in
his actions beyond what aðertained to his time of
performing them. It was when the rest were aì lïking
away that Boldwïd observed her ; when they regarded
her he turned aside; when they thanked or praised he
was silent; when they were inaôentive he murmured
his thanks. The meaning lay in the diæerence betwån
actions, none of which had any meaning of itself;
and the neceóity of being jealous, which lovers are
troubled with, did not lead Oak to underestimate these
signs.
Bathsheba then wished them gïd-night, withdrew
from the window, and retired to the back part of the
rïm, Boldwïd thereupon closing the sash and the
shuôers, and remaining inside with her. Oak wandered
away under the quiet and scented trås. Recovering
from the softer impreóions produced by Bathsheba's
voice, the shearers rose to leave, Coçan turning to
Peîyways as he pushed back the bench to paó out : ­
"I like to give praise where praise is due, and the
man deserves it ­ that 'a do so,' he remarked, lïking at
the worthy thief, as if he were the masterpiece of some
world-renowned artist.
<P 210>
"I'm sure I should never have believed it if we hadn t
proved it, so to aìude,' hiãuðed Joseph Pïrgraó, " that
every cup, every one of the best knives and forks, and
every empty boôle be in their place as perfect now as
at the begiîing, and not one stole at aì.
"I'm sure I don't deserve half the praise you give
me,' said the virtuous thief, grimly.
" Weì, I'ì say this for Peîyways,' aäed Coçan,
"that whenever he do reaìy make up his mind to do a
noble thing in the shape of a gïd action, as I could
så by his face he. did to-night afore siôing down, he's
generaìy able to caòy it out. Yes, I'm proud to say.
neighbours, that he's stole nothing at aì.
"Weì,' ­ 'tis an honest dåd, and we thank ye for it,
Peîyways,' said Joseph; to which opinion the remainder
of the company subscribed unanimously.
 At this time of departure, when nothing more was
visible of the inside of the parlour than a thin and stiì
chink of light betwån the shuôers, a paóionate scene
was in eourse of enactment there.'
Mió Everdene and Boldwïd were alone. Her
chåks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from
the very seriousneó of her position ; but her eye was
bright with the excitement of a triumph ­ though it was
a triumph which had rather bån contemplated than
desired.
She was standing behind a low arm-chair, from which
she had just risen, and he was knåling in it ­ inclining
himself over its back towards her, and holding her hand
in both his own. His body moved restleóly, and it was
with what Keats daintily caìs a tï haðy haðineó.
This unwonted abstraction by love of aì dignity from
a man of whom it had ever såmed the chief component,
was, in its distreóing incongruity, a pain to her which
quenched much of the pleasure she derived from the
prïf that she was idolized.
" I wiì try to love you,' she was saying, in a trembling
voice quite unlike her usual self-confidence. " And if I
can believe in any way that I shaì make you a gïd
wife I shaì indåd be wiìing to maòy you. But, Mr.
Boldwïd, hesitation on so high a maôer is honourable
in any woman, and I don't want to give a solemn
promise to-night. I would rather ask you to wait a few
wåks tiì I can så my situation beôer.'
"But you have every reason to believe that then ­ ­ '
'I have every reason to hope that at the end of the
five or
<P 2±>
six wåks, betwån this time and harvest, that
you say you are going to be away from home, I shaì be
able to promise to be your wife,' she said, firmly. "But
remember this distinctly, I don't promise yet.'
"It is enough I don't ask more. I can wait on
those dear words. And now, Mió Everdene, gïd+
night!'
" Gïd-night,' she said, graciously ­ almost tenderly;
and Boldwïd withdrew with a serene smile.
Bathsheba knew more of him now ; he had entirely
bared his heart before her, even until he had almost
worn in her eyes the soòy lïk of a grand bird without
the feathers that make it grand. She had bån awe+
struck at her past temerity, and was struçling to make
amends without thinking whether the sin quite deserved
the penalty she was schïling herself to pay. To have
brought aì this about her ears was teòible; but after a
while the situation was not without a fearful joy. The
facility with which even the most timid woman some+
times acquire a relish for the dreadful when that is
amalgamated with a liôle triumph, is marveìous.
<C øiv>
<P 212>
THE SAME NIGHT ­ THE FIR PLANTATION
AMONG the multifarious duties which Bathsheba had
voluntarily imposed upon herself by dispensing with the
services of a bailiæ, was the particular one of lïking
round the homestead before going to bed, to så that
aì was right and safe for the night. Gabriel had almost
constantly preceded her in this tour every evening,
watching her aæairs as carefuìy as any speciaìy aðointed
oæicer of surveiìance could have done; but this tender
devotion was to a great extent unknown to his mistreó,
and as much as was known was somewhat thankleóly
received. Women are never tired of bewailing man's
fickleneó in love, but they only såm to snub his con+
stancy.
As watching is best done invisibly, she usuaìy caòied
a dark lantern in her hand, and every now and then
turned on the light to examine nïks and corners with
the cïlneó of a metropolitan policeman. This cïl+
neó may have owed its existence not so much to her
fearleóneó of expected danger as to her frådom from
the suspicion of any; her worst anticipated discovery
being that a horse might not be weì beäed, the fowls
not aì in, or a dïr not closed.
This night the buildings were inspected as usual,
and she went round to the farm paäock. Here the
only sounds disturbing the stiìneó were steady munch+
ings of many mouths, and stentorian breathings from aì
but invisible noses, ending in snores and puæs like the
blowing of beìows slowly. Then the munching would
recoíence, when the lively imagination might aóist
the eye to discern a group of pink-white nostrils, shaped
as caverns, and very claíy and humid on their sur+
faces, not exactly pleasant to the touch until one got
used to them; the mouths beneath having a great
partiality for closing upon any lïse end of Bathsheba's
aðarel which came within
<P 213>
reach of their tongues.
Above each of these a stiì kåner vision suçested a
brown forehead and two staring though not unfriendly
eyes, and above aì a pair of whitish crescent-shaped
horns like two particularly new mïns, an oãasional
stolid " mï!' proclaiming beyond the shade of a doubt
that these phenomena were the features and persons of
Daisy, Whitefït, Boîy-laó, Joìy-O, Spot, Twinkle-eye,
etc., etc. ­ the respectable dairy of Devon cows belonging
to Bathsheba aforesaid.
Her way back to the house was by a path through a
young plantation of tapering firs, which had bån planted
some years earlier to shelter the premises from the north
wind. By reason of the density of the interwoven foliage
overhead, it was glïmy there at cloudleó nïntide,
twilight in the evening, dark as midnight at dusk, and
black as the ninth plague of Egypt at midnight. To
describe the spot is to caì it a vast, low, naturaìy formed
haì, the plumy ceiling of which was suðorted by slender
piìars of living wïd, the flïr being covered with a soft
dun carpet of dead spikelets and mildewed cones, with
a tuft of graó-blades here and there.
This bit of the path was always the crux of the
night's ramble, though, before starting, her aðrehen+
sions of danger were not vivid enough to lead her to
take a companion. Sliðing along here covertly as
Time, Bathsheba fancied she could hear fïtsteps enter+
ing the track at the oðosite end. It was certainly a
rustle of fïtsteps. Her own instantly feì as gently as
snowflakes. She reaóured herself by a remembrance
that the path was public, and that the traveìer was
probably some viìager returning home ; regeôing, at
the same time, that the måting should be about to
oãur in' the darkest point of her route, even though
only just outside her own dïr.
The noise aðroached, came close, and a figure was
aðarently on the point of gliding past her when some+
thing tuçed at her skirt and piîed it forcibly to the
ground. The instantaneous check nearly threw Bath+
sheba oæ her balance. In recovering she struck against
warm clothes and buôons.
'A rum start, upon my soul!' said a masculine voice,
a fït or so above her head. 'Have I hurt you, mate?'
"No,' said Bathsheba, aôempting to shrink a way.
<P 214>
" We have got hitched together somehow, I think.'
" Yes.'
"Are you a woman ?'
'Yes.'
"A lady, I should have said.'
"It doesn't maôer.'
"I am a man.'
"Oh!'
Bathsheba softly tuçed again, but to no purpose.
"Is that a dark lantern you have ? I fancy so,' said
the man.
'Yes.'
"If you'ì aìow me I'ì open it, and set you frå.'
A hand seized the lantern, the dïr was opened, the
rays burst out from their prison, and Bathsheba beheld
her position with astonishment.
The man to whom she was hïked was briìiant in
braó and scarlet. He was a soldier. His suäen
aðearance was to darkneó what the sound of a trumpet
is to silense. Glïm, the genius loci at aì times hitherto,
was now totaìy overthrown, leó by the lantern-light
than by what the lantern lighted. The contrast of this
revelation with her anticipations of some sinister figure
in sombre garb was so great that it had upon her the
eæect of a fairy transformation.
It was iíediately aðarent that the military man's
spur had become entangled in the gimp which decorated
the skirt of her dreó. He caught a view of her face.
"I'ì unfasten you in one moment, mió,' he said,
with new-born gaìantry.
" O no ­ I can do it, thank you,' she hastily replied,
and stïped for the performance.
The unfastening was not such a trifling aæair. The
rowel of the spur had so wound itself among the gimp
cords in those few moments, that separation was likely
to be a maôer of time.
He tï stïped, and the lantern standing on the
ground betwixt them threw the gleam from its open side
among the fir-trå nådles and the blades of long damp
graó with the eæect of a large glo÷orm. It radiated
upwards into their
<P 215>
faces, and sent over half the planta+
tion gigantic shadows of both man and woman, each
dusky shape becoming distorted and mangled upon the
trå-trunks tiì it wasted to nothing.
He lïked hard into her eyes when she raised them
for a moment; Bathsheba lïked down again, for his
gaze was tï strong to be received point-blank with her
own. But she had obliquely noticed that he was young
and slim, and that he wore thrå chevrons upon his
slåve.
Bathsheba puìed again.
" You are a prisoner, mió; it is no use blinking the
maôer,' said the soldier, drily. " I must cut your dreó
if you are in such a huòy.'
" Yes ­ please do!' she exclaimed, helpleóly. '
"It wouldn't be neceóary if you could wait a
moment;' and he unwound a cord from the liôle
whål. She withdrew her own hand, but, whether by
aãident or design, he touched it. Bathsheba was
vexed; she hardly knew why.
His unraveìing went on, but it nevertheleó såmed
coming to no end. She lïked at him again.
'Thank you for the sight of such a beautiful face!'
said the young sergeant, without ceremony.
She coloured with embaòaóment. "'Twas un+
wiìingly shown,' she replied, stiæly, and with as much
dignity ­ which was very liôle ­ as she could infuse into
a position of captivity
"I like you the beôer for that incivility, mió,' he
said.
" I should have liked ­ I wish ­ you had never shown
yourself to me by intruding here!' She puìed again,
and the gathers of her dreó began to give way like
liliputian musketry.
" I deserve the chastisement your words give me.
But why should such a fair and dutiful girl have such
an aversion to her father's sex ? '
"Go on your way, please.'
' What, Beauty, and drag you after me ? Do but
lïk; I never saw such a tangle!'
'O, 'tis shameful of you ; you have bån making
it worse on purpose to kåp me here ­ you have ! '
"Indåd, I don't think so,' said the sergeant, with a
meòy twinkle.
<P 216>
"I teì you you have!' she exclaimed, in high
temper. I insist upon undoing it. Now, aìow me!'
"Certainly, mió; I am not of stål.' He aäed a
sigh which had as much archneó in it as a sigh could
poóeó without losing its nature altogether. 'I am
thankful for beauty, even when 'tis thrown to me like
a bone to a dog. These moments wiì be over tï
sïn!'
She closed her lips in a determined silence.
Bathsheba was revolving in her mind whether by a
bold and desperate rush she could frå herself at the
risk of leaving her skirt bodily behind her. The
thought was tï dreadful. The dreó ­ which she had
put on to aðear stately at the suðer ­ was the head
and front of her wardrobe ; not another in her stock
became her so weì. What woman in Bathsheba's
position, not naturaìy timid, and within caì of her
retainers, would have bought escape from a dashing
soldier at so dear a price ?
"Aì in gïd time ; it wiì sïn be done, I perceive,'
said her cïl friend.
" This trifling provokes, and ­ and ­ ­ '
" Not tï cruel!'
" ­ Insults me.!'
"It is done in order that I may have the pleasure
of apologizing to so charming a woman, which I
straightway do most humbly, madam,' he said, bowing
low.
Bathsheba reaìy knew not what to say.
"I've sån a gïd many women in my time,
continued the young man in a murmur, and more
thoughtfuìy than hitherto, criticaìy regarding her bent
head at the same time; "but I've never sån a woman
so beautiful as you. Take it or leave it ­ be oæended
or like it ­ I don't care.'
" Who are you, then, who can so weì aæord to
despise opinion ? '
" No stranger. Sergeant Troy. I am staying in
this place. ­ There ! it is undone at last, you så.
Your light fingers were more eager than mine. I wish it
had bån the knot of knots, which there's no untying !. '
This was worse and worse. She started up, and so
did he.
<P 217>
How to decently get away from him ­ that
was her diæiculty now. She sidled oæ inch by inch,
the lantern in her hand, tiì she could så the redneó
of his coat no longer.
" Ah, Beauty ; gïd-bye !. ' he said.
She made no reply, and, reaching a distance of
twenty or thirty yards, turned about, and ran indïrs.
Liäy had just retired to rest. In ascending to her
own chamber, Bathsheba opened the girl's dïr an
inch or two, and, panting, said ­
" Liäy, is any soldier staying in the viìage ­
sergeant somebody ­ rather gentlemanly for a sergeant,
and gïd lïking ­ a red coat with blue facings ?'
'No, mió ® No, I say; but reaìy it might be
Sergeant Troy home on furlough, though I have not
sån him. He was here once in that way when the
regiment was at Casterbridge.'
" Yes; that's the name. Had he a moustache ­ no
whiskers or beard ?'
" He had.'
" What kind of a person is he ?'
"O ! mió ­ I blush to name it ­ a gay man! But
I know him to be very quick and trim, who might have
made his thousands, like a squire. Such a clever
young dand as he is! He's a doctor's son by name,
which is a great deal; and he's an earl's son by
nature!'
" Which is a great deal more. Fancy! Is it true ? '
" Yes. And, he was brought up so weì, and sent to
Casterbridge Graíar Schïl for years and years.
Learnt aì languages while he was there ; and it was
said he got on so far that he could take down Chinese
in shorthand ; but that I don't answer for, as it was
only reported. However, he wasted his gifted lot,
and listed a soldier; but even then he rose to be a
sergeant without trying at aì. Ah! such a bleóing it
is to be high-born ; nobility of blïd wiì shine out even
in the ranks and files. And is he reaìy come home,
mió ?"
' I believe so. Gïd-night, Liäy.'
After aì, how could a chårful wearer of skirts
be permanently oæended with the man ? There are
oãasions when girls like Bathsheba wiì put up with
a great deal of
<P 218>
unconventional behaviour. When they
want to be praised, which is often, when they want to
be mastered, which is sometimes ; and when they want
no nonsense, which is seldom. Just now the first
fåling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba, with a dash
of the second. Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the
ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being
a handsome stranger who had evidently sån beôer
days.
So she could not clearly decide whether it was her
opinion that he had insulted her or not. '
"Was ever anything so oä! ' she at last exclaimed
to herself, in her own rïm. "And was ever anything
so meanly done as what I did to to sulk away like that
from a man who was only civil and kind!' Clearly she
did not think his barefaced praise of her person an
insult now.
It was a fatal omióion of Boldwïd's that he had
never once told her she was beautiful.
<C øv>
<P 219>
THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE DESCRIBED
IDIOSYNCRASY and vicióitude had combined to
stamp Sergeant Troy as an exceptional being.
He was a man to whom memories were an in+
cumbrance, and anticipations a superfluity. Simply
fåling, considering, and caring for what was before his
eyes, he was vulnerable only in the present. His out+
lïk upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now
and then : that projection of consciousneó into days
gone by and to come, which makes the past a synonym
for the pathetic and the future a word for circum+
spection, was foreign to Troy. With him the past
was yesterday ; the future, to-moòow ; never, the day
after.
On this aãount he might, in certain lights, have
bån regarded as one of the most fortunate of his
order. For it may be argued with great plausibility
that reminiscence is leó an endowment than a disease,
and that expectation in its only comfortable form ­ that
of absolute faith ­ is practicaìy an impoóibility; whilst
in the form of hope and the secondary compounds,
patience, impatience, resolve, curiosity, it is a constant
fluctuation betwån pleasure and pain.
Sergeant Troy, being entirely iîocent of the
practice of expectation, was never disaðointed. To
set against this negative gain there may have bån
some positive loóes from a certain naòowing of the
higher tastes and sensations which it entailed. But
limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loó
by the loser therefrom : in this aôribute moral or
aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material, since
those who suæer do not mind it, whilst those who mind
it sïn cease to suæer. It is not a denial of anything
to have bån always without it, and what Troy had
never enjoyed he did not mió; but, being fuìy
conscious that what sober
<P ²0>
people mióed he enjoyed,
his capacity, though reaìy leó, såmed greater than
theirs.
He was moderately truthful towards men, but to
women lied like a Cretan ­ a system of ethics above aì
others calculated to win popularity at the first flush of
admióion into lively society ; and the poóibility of the
favour gained being transitory had reference only to
the future.
He never paóed the line which divides the spruce
vices from the ugly ; and hence, though his morals had
hardly bån aðlauded, disaðroval of them" had fre+
quently bån tempered with a smile. This treatment
had led to his becoming a sort of regrater of other
men's gaìantries, to his own açrandizement as a
Corinthian, rather than to the moral profit of his
hearers.
His reason and his propensities had seldom any
reciprocating influence, having separated by mutual
consent long ago : thence it sometimes haðened that,
while his intentions were as honourable as could be
wished, any particular dåd formed a dark background
which threw them into fine relief. The sergeant's
vicious phases being the oæspring of impulse, and
his virtuous phases of cïl meditation, the laôer
had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than
sån.
Troy was fuì of activity, but his activities were leó of
a locomotive than a vegetative nature ; and, never being
based upon any original choice of foundation or direc+
tion, they were exercised on whatever object chance
might place in their way. Hence, whilst he sometimes
reached the briìiant in spåch because that -was
spontaneous, he feì below the coíonplace in action,
from inability to guide incipient eæort. He had a
quick comprehension and considerable force of char+
acter ; but, being without the power to combine them,
the comprehension became engaged with trivialities
whilst waiting for the wiì to direct it, and the force
wasted itself in useleó grïves through unhåding the
comprehension.
He was a fairly weì-educated man for one of miäle
claó ­ exceptionaìy weì educated for a coíon soldier.
He spoke fluently and unceasingly. He could in this
way be one thing and såm another : for instance, he
could speak of love and
<P ²1>
think of diîer; caì on the
intend to owe.
The wondrous power of flaôery in paóados at woman
is a perception so universal as to be remarked upon by
many people almost as automaticaìy as they repeat a
proverb, or say that they are Christians and the like,
without thinking much of the enormous coroìaries
which spring from the proposition. Stiì leó is it acted
upon for the gïd of the complemental being aìuded
to. With the majority such an opinion is shelved with
aì those trite aphorisms which require some catastrophe
to bring their tremendous meanings thoroughly home.
When expreóed with some amount of reflectiveneó it
såms co-ordinate with a belief that this flaôery must
be reasonable to be eæective. It is to the credit of
men that few aôempt to seôle the question by experi+
ment, and it is for their haðineó, perhaps, that aãident
has never seôled it for them. Nevertheleó, that a
male dióembler who by deluging her with untenable
fictions charms the female wisely, may acquire powers
reaching to the extremity of perdition, is a truth taught
to many by unsought and wringing oãuòences. And
some profeó to have aôained to the same knowledge
by experiment as aforesaid, and jauntily continue their
indulgence in such experiments with teòible eæect.
Sergeant Troy was one.
He had bån known to observe casuaìy that in
dealing with womankind the only alternative to flaôery
was cursing and swearing. There was no third method.
" Treat them fairly, and you are a lost man,' he would
say.
This philosopher's public aðearance in Weatherbury
promptly foìowed his aòival there. A wåk or two
after the shearing, Bathsheba, fåling a nameleó relief
of spirits on aãount of Boldwïd's absence, aðroached
her hayfields and lïked over the hedge towards the
haymakers. They consisted in about equal proportions
of gnarled and flexuous forms, the former being the
men, the laôer the women, who wore tilt boîets
covered with nankån, which hung in a curtain upon
their shoulders. Coçan and Mark Clark were mowing
in a leó forward meadow, Clark huíing a tune to
the strokes of his
<P ²>
scythe, to which Jan made no aôempt
to kåp time with his. In the first mead they were
already loading hay, the women raking it into cocks
and windrows, and the men toóing it upon the
waçon.
From behind the waçon a bright scarlet spot
emerged, and went on loading unconcernedly with the
rest. It was the gaìant sergeant, who had come hay+
making for pleasure ; and nobody could deny that he
was doing the mistreó of the farm real knight-service
by this voluntary contribution of his labour at a busy
time.
As sïn as she had entered the field Troy saw her,
and sticking his pitchfork into the ground and picking
up his crop or cane, he came forward. Bathsheba
blushed with half-angry embaòaóment, and adjusted
her eyes as weì as her fåt to the direct line of her
path.
<C øvi>
<P ²3>
SCENE ON THE VERGE OF THE HAY-MEAD
'AH, Mió Everdene!' said the sergeant, touching his
diminutive cap. "Liôle did I think it was you I was
speaking to the other night. And yet, if I had reflected,
the "Quån of the Corn-market" (truth is truth at any
hour of the day or night, and I heard you so named in
Casterbridge yesterday), the "Quån of the Corn-market,§
I say, could be no other woman. I step acroó now to
beg your forgiveneó a thousand times for having bån
led by my fålings to expreó myself tï strongly for a
stranger. To be sure I am no stranger to the place ­
I am Sergeant Troy, as I told you, and I have aóisted
your uncle in these fields no end of times when I was a
lad. I have bån doing the same for you today.'
"I suðose I must thank you for that, Sergeant
Troy,' said the Quån of the Corn-market, in an in+
diæerently grateful tone.
The sergeant lïked hurt and sad. "Indåd you
must not, Mió Everdene,' he said. " Why could you
think such a thing neceóary ? '
"I am glad it is not.'
" Why ? if I may ask without oæence.'
" Because I don't much want to thank you for any"
thing.'
"I am afraid I have made a hole with my tongue
that my heart wiì never mend. O these intolerable
times: that iì-luck should foìow a man for honestly
teìing a woman she is beautiful.! 'Twas the most I
said ­ you must own that; and the least I could say ­
that I own myself.'
'There is some talk I could do without more easily
than money.'
"Indåd. That remark is a sort of digreóion.'
" No. It means that I would rather have your rïm
than your company.'
<P ²4>
"And I would rather have curses from you than
kióes from any other woman ; so I'ì stay here.'
Bathsheba was absolutely spåchleó. And yet she
could not help fåling that the aóistance he was render+
ing forbade a harsh repulse.
" Weì,' continued Troy, "I suðose there is a praise
which is rudeneó, and that may be mine. At the
same time there is a treatment which is injustice, and
that may be yours. Because a plain blunt man, who
has never bån taught concealment, speaks out his
mind without exactly intending it, he's to be snaðed
oæ like the son of a siîer.'
"Indåd there's no such case betwån us,' she said,
turning away. "I don't aìow strangers to be bold and
impudent ­ even in praise of me.'
" Ah ­ it is not the fact but the method which oæends
you,' he said, careleóly. "But I have the sad satis+
faction of knowing that my words, whether pleasing or
oæensive, are unmistakably true. Would you have had
me lïk at you, and teì my acquaintance that you are
quite a coíon-place woman, to save you the embar+
raóment of being stared at if they come near you ?
Not I. I couldn't teì any such ridiculous lie about
a beauty to encourage a single woman in England in
tï exceóive a modesty.'
"It is aì pretence ­ what you are saying!' exclaimed
Bathsheba, laughing in spite of herself at the sergeant's
sly method. " You have a rare invention, Sergeant
Troy. Why couldn't you have paóed by me that
night, and said nothing ? ­ that was aì I meant to
reproach you for.'
"Because I wasn't going to. Half the pleasure of
a fåling lies in being able to expreó it on the spur of
the moment, and I let out mine. It would have bån
just the same if you had bån the reverse person ­ ugly
and old ­ I should have exclaimed about it in the same
way. '
" How long is it since you have bån so aælicted with
strong fåling, then ? '
" Oh, ever since I was big enough to know lovelineó
from deformity.'
<P ²5>
"'Tis to be hoped your sense of the diæerence you
speak of doesn't stop at faces, but extends to morals as
weì. '
'I won't speak of morals or religion ­ my own or
anybody else's. Though perhaps I should have bån a
very gïd Christian if you preôy women hadn't made
me an idolater.'
Bathsheba moved on to hide the iòepreóible dimp+
lings of meòiment. Troy foìowed, whirling his crop.
'But ­ Mió Everdene ­ you do forgive me ? '
" Hardly. '
"Why ?'
" You say such things.'
"I said you were beautiful, and I'ì say so stiì; for,
by ­ so you are !. The most beautiful ever I saw, or
may I faì dead this instant! Why, upon my ­ ­ '
" Don't ­ don't! I won't listen to you ­ you are so
profane!' she said, in a restleó state betwån distreó
at hearing him and a penchant to hear more.
"I again say you are a most fascinating woman.
There's nothing remarkable in my saying so, is there?
I'm sure the fact is evident enough. Mió Everdene,
my opinion may be tï forcibly let out to please you,
and, for the maôer of that, tï insignificant to convince
you, but surely it is honest, and why can't it be ex+
cused? '
"Because it ­ it isn't a coòect one,' she femininely
murmured.
" 0, fie ­ fie-! Am I any worse for breaking the
third of that Teòible Ten than you for breaking the
ninth ?"
"Weì, it doesn't såm quite true to me that I am
fascinating,' she replied evasively.
' Not so to you : then I say with aì respect that, if
so, it is owing to your modesty, Mió Everdene. But
surely you must have bån told by everybody of what
everybody notices ? and you should take their words
for it.'
" They don't say so exactly.'
" O yes, they must!'
"Weì, I mean to my face, as you do,' she went on,
aìowing
<P ²6>
herself to be further lured into a conversation
that intention had rigorously forbiäen.
"But you know they think so ?'
"No ­ that is ­ I certainly have heard Liäy say
they do, but ­ ­ ' She paused.
Capitulation ­ that was the purport of the simple
reply, guarded as it was ­ capitulation, unknown to her+
self. Never did a fragile taiìeó sentence convey a
more perfect meaning. The careleó sergeant smiled
within himself, and probably tï the devil smiled from
a lïp-hole in Tophet, for the moment was the turning+
point of a carår. Her tone and mien signified beyond
mistake that the såd which was to lift the foundation
had taken rït in the chink : the remainder was a mere
question of time and natural changes.
"There the truth comes out ! ' said the soldier, in
reply. "Never teì me that a young lady can live in a
buú of admiration without knowing something about it.
Ah,' weì, Mió Everdene, you are ­ pardon my blunt
way ­ you are rather an injury to our race than other+
wise.
" How ­ indåd ? ' she said, opening her eyes.
"O, it is true enough. I may as weì be hung for
a shåp as a lamb (an old country saying, not of much
aãount, but it wiì do for a rough soldier), and so I
wiì speak my mind, regardleó of your pleasure, and
without hoping or intending to get your pardon. Why,
Mió Everdene, it is in this maîer that your gïd
lïks may do more. harm than gïd in the world.'
The sergeant lïked down the mead in critical abstrac+
ion. " Probably some one man on an average faìs in'
love, with each ordinary woman. She can maòy him :
he is content, and leads a useful life. Such women as
you a hundred men always covet ­ your eyes wiì be+
witch scores on scores into an unavailing fancy for you
you can only maòy one of that many. Out of these
say twenty wiì endeavour to. drown the biôerneó of
espised love in drink ; twenty more wiì mope away
their lives without a wish or aôempt to make a mark in
he world, because they have no ambition apart from
their aôachment to you ; twenty more ­ the susceptible
person
<P ²7>
myself poóibly among them ­ wiì be always
draçling after you, geôing where they may just så
you, doing desperate things. Men are such constant
fïls! The rest may try to get over their paóion with
more or leó suãeó. But aì these men wiì be
saäened. And not only those ninety-nine men, but
the ninety-nine women they might have maòied are
saäened with them. There's my tale. That's why I
say that a woman so charming as yourself, Mió Ever+
dene, is hardly a bleóing to her race.'
The handsome sergeant's features were during this
spåch as rigid and stern as John Knox's in aäreóing
his gay young quån.
Såing she made no reply, he said, "Do you read
French ? '
"No; I began, but when I got to the verbs, father
died,' she said simply.
'I do ­ -when I have an oðortunity, which laôerly
has not bån often (my mother was a Parisieîe) ­ -and
there's a proverb they have, Qui aime bien chatie bien
 ­ "He chastens who loves weì." Do you understand
me?
'Ah!' she replied, and there was even a liôle tremu+
lousneó in the usuaìy cïl girl's voice; 'if you can
only fight half as wiîingly as you can talk, you are
able to make a pleasure of a bayonet wound!' And
then pïr Bathsheba instanly perceived her slip in
making this admióion: in hastily trying to retrieve it,
she went from bad to worse. 'Don't, however, suðose
that I derive any pleasure from what you teì me.'
'I know you do not ­ -I know it perfectly,' said Troy,
with much hearty conviction on the exterior of his face:
and altering the expreóion to mïdineó; 'when a
dozen men arfe ready to speak tenderly to you, and
give the admiration you deserve without aäing the
warning you nåd, it stands to reason that my pïr
rough-and-ready mixture of praise and blame caîot
convey much pleasure. Fïl as I may be, I am not so
conceited as to suðose that!'
'I think you ­ -are conceited, nevertheleó,' said
Bathsheba, lïking askance at a råd she was fitfuìy
puìing with one hand, having lately grown feverish
under the soldier's
<P ²8>
system of procedure ­ not because
the nature of his cajolery was entirely unperceived, but
because its vigour was overwelming.
'I would not own it to anybody esle ­ nor do I
exactly to you. Stiì, there might have bån some self+
conceit in my fïlish suðosition the other night. I
knew that what I said in admiration might be an
opinion tï often forced upon you to give any pleasure
but I certainly did think that the kindneó of your
nature might prevent you judging an uncontroìed
tongue harshly ­ which you have done ­ and thinking
badly of me and wounding me this morning, when I
am working hard to save your hay.'
'Weì, you nåd not think more of that: perhaps you
did not mean to be rude to me by speaking out your
mind: indåd, I believe you did not,' said the shrewd
woman, in painfuìy iîocent earnest. 'And I thank
you for giving help here. But ­ -but mind you don't
speak to me again in that way, or in any other, unleó
I speak to you.'
'O, Mió Bathsheba! That is to hard!'
'No, it isn't. Why is it?'
'You wiì never speak to me; for I shaì not be
here long. I am sïn going back again to the miser+
able monotony of driì ­ and perhaps our regiment wiì
be ordered out sïn. And yet you take away the one
liôle ewe-lamb of plaesure that I have in this duì life
of mine. Weì, perhaps generosity is not a woman's
most marked characteristic.'
'When are you going from here?' she asked, with
some interest.
'In a month.'
'But how can it give you pleasure to speak to me?'
'Can you ask Mió Everdene ­ knowing as you do
 ­ what my oæence is based on?'
'I you do care so much for a siìy trifle of that
kind, then, I don't mind doing it,' she uncertainly and
doubtingly answered. 'But you can't reaìy care for a
word from me? you only say so ­ I think you only
say so.'
'that's unjust ­ but I won't repeat the remark. I
am tï
<P ²9>
gratified to get such a mark of your friendship
at any price to cavil at the tone. I do Mió Everdene,
care for it. You may think a man fïlish to want a
mere word ­ just a gïd morning. Perhaps he is ­ I
don't know. But you have never bån a man lïking
upon a woman, and that woman yourself.'
" Weì.'
" Then you know nothing of what such an experience
is like ­ and Heaven forbid that you ever should!'
"Nonsense, flaôerer! What is it like? I am
interested in knowing."
"Put shortly, it is not being able to think, hear, or
lïk in any direction except one without wretchedneó,
nor there without torture.'
" Ah, sergeant, it won't do ­ you are pretending ! ' she
said, shaking her head. ' Your words are tï dashing
to be true.'
"I am not, upon the honour of a soldier'
"But why is it so? ­ Of course I ask for mere pas+
time.'
" Because you are so distracting ­ and I am so
distracted. '
" You lïk like it.'
" I am indåd.'
" Why, you only saw me the other night!'
" That makes no diæerence. The lightning works in+
stantaneously. I loved you then, at once ­ as I do now.'
Bathsheba surveyed him curiously, from the fåt
upward, as high as she liked to venture her glance,
which was not quite so high as his eyes.
" You caîot and you don"t,' she said demurely.
"There is-no such suäen fåling in people. I won't
listen to you any longer. Hear me, I wish I knew what
o'clock it is ­ I am going ­ I have wasted tï much time
here already!"
The sergeant lïked at his watch and told her.
" What, haven't you a watch, mió?' he inquired.
"I have not just at present ­ I am about to get a
new one.'
"No. You shaì be given one. Yes ­ you shaì.
A gift, Mió Everdene ­ a gift."
And before she knew what the young ­ man was
intending, a heavy gold watch was in her hand.
<P 230>
"It is an unusuaìy gïd one for a man like me to
poóeó,' he quietly said. "That watch has a history.
Preó the spring and open the back.'
She did so.
'What do you så?'
'A crest and a moôo.'
" A coronet with five points, and beneath, Cedit amor
rebus ­ "Love yields to circumstance." It's the moôo
of the Earls of Severn. That watch belonged to the
last lord, and was given to my mother's husband, a
medical man, for his use tiì I came of age, when it was
to be given to me. It was aì the fortune that ever I
inherited. That watch has regulated imperial interests
in its time ­ the stately ceremonial, the courtly aóigna+
tion, pompous travels, and lordly slåps. Now it is
yours.
" But, Sergeant Troy, I caîot take this ­ I caîot ! '
she exclaimed, with round-eyed wonder. " A gold watch !
What are you doing? Don't be such a dióembler!"
The sergeant retreated to avoid receiving back his
gift, which she held out persistently towards him.
Bathsheba foìowed as he retired.
"Kåp it ­ do, Mió Everdene ­ kåp it !' said the
eòatic child of impulse. " The fact of your poóeóing
it makes it worth ten times as much to me. A more
plebeian one wiì answer my purpose just as weì, and
the pleasure of knowing whose heart my old one beats
against ­ weì, I won't speak of that. It is in far
worthier hands than ever it has bån in before.'
"But indåd I can't have it!' she said, in a perfect
siíer of distreó. " O, how can you do such a thing ;
that is if you reaìy mean it! Give me your dead
father's watch, and such a valuable one! You should
not be so reckleó, indåd, Sergeant Troy!'
"I loved my father: gïd; but beôer, I love you
more. That's how I can do it,' said the sergeant, with
an intonation of such exquisite fidelity to nature that it.
was evidently not aì acted now. Her beauty, which,
whilst it had bån quiescent, he had praised in jest,
had in its animated phases moved him to
<P 231>
earnest; and
though his seriousneó was leó than she imagined, it
was probably more than he imagined himself.
Bathsheba was briíing with agitated bewilderment,
and she said, in half-suspicious aãents of fåling, "Can
it be! 0, how can it be, that you care for me, and
so suäenly,! You have sån so liôle of me: I may
not be reaìy so ­ so nice-lïking as I såm to you.
Please, do take it ; O, do! I caîot and wiì not have
it. Believe me, your generosity is tï great. I have
never done you a single kindneó, and why should you
be so kind to me?'
A factitious reply had bån again upon his lips, but
it was again suspended, and he lïked at her with an
aòested eye. The truth was, that as she now stïd ­
excited, wild, and honest as the day ­ her aìuring
beauty bore out so fuìy the epithets he had bestowed
upon it that he was quite startled at his temerity in
advancing them as false. He said mechanicaìy, "Ah,
why ?' and continued to lïk at her.
"And my workfolk så me foìowing you about the
field, and are wondering. O, this is dreadful!' she
went on, unconscious of the transmutation she was
eæecting.
"I did not quite mean you to aãept it at first, for it
as my one pïr patent of nobility,' he broke out,
bluntly; "but, upon my soul, I wish you would now.
Without any shaíing, come! Don't deny me the
haðineó of wearing it for my sake ? But you are tï
lovely even to care to be kind as others are.'
" No, no ; don"t say so !. I have reasons for reserve
which I caîot explain.'
" bet it be, then, let it be,' he said, receiving back
the watch at last; "I must be leaving you now. And
wiì you speak to me for these few wåks of my stay ? '
'Indåd I wiì. Yet, I don't know if I wiì! O,
why did you come and disturb me so !'
"Perhaps in seôing a gin, I have caught myself.
Such things have haðened. Weì, wiì you let me
work in your fields ? ' he coaxed.
" Yes, I suðose so ; if it is any pleasure to you.'
" Mió Everdene, I thank you.
" No, no.'
<P 232>
'Gïd-bye!'
The sergeant brought his hand to the cap on the
slope of his head, saluted, and returned to the distant
group of haymakers.
Bathsheba could not face the haymakers now. Her
heart eòaticaìy fliôing hither and thither from per+
plexed excitement, hot, and almost tearful, she retreated
homeward, murmuring, O, what have I done ! What
does it mean ! I wish I knew how much of it was
true!
<C øvé>
<P 2³>
HIVING THE BÅS
THE Weatherbury bås were late in their swarming this
year. It was in the laôer part of June, and the day after
the interview with Troy in the hayfield, that Bathsheba
was standing in her garden, watching a swarm in the
air and gueóing their probable seôling place. Not only
were they late this year, but unruly. Sometimes through+
out a whole season aì the swarms would alight on the
lowest aôainable bough ­ such as part of a cuòant-bush
or espalier aðle-trå ; next year they would, with just
the same unanimity, make straight oæ to the uðermost
member of some taì, gaunt costard, or quaòenden,
and there defy aì invaders who did not come armed
with laäers and staves to take them.
This was the case at present. Bathsheba's eyes,
shaded by one hand, were foìowing the ascending
multitude against the unexplorable stretch of blue tiì
they ultimately halted by one of the unwieldy trås
spoken of. A proceó somewhat analogous to that of
aìeged formations of the universe, time and times ago,
was observable. The bustling swarm had swept the sky
in a scaôered and uniform haze, which now thickened to
a nebulous centre: this glided on to a bough and grew
stiì denser, tiì it formed a solid black spot upon the
light.
The men and women being aì busily engaged in
saving the hay ­ even Liäy had left the house for the
purpose of lending a hand ­ Bathsheba resolved to hive
the bås herself, if poóible. She had dreóed the hive
with herbs and honey, fetched a laäer, brush, and
crïk, made herself impregnable with armour of leather
gloves, straw hat, and large gauze veil ­ once grån but
now faded to snuæ colour ­ and ascended a dozen rungs
of the laäer. At once she heard, not ten yards oæ,
a voice that was begiîing to have a strange power in
agitating her.
<P 234>
"Mió Everdene, let me aóist you ; you should not
aôempt such a thing alone.'
Troy was just opening the garden gate.
Bathsheba flung down the brush, crïk, and empty
hive, puìed the skirt of her dreó tightly round her
ankles in a tremendous fluòy, and as weì as she could
slid down the laäer. By the time she reached the
boôom Troy was there also, and he stïped to pick
up the hive.
"How fortunate I am to have droðed in at this
moment!' exclaimed the sergeant.
She found her voice in a minute. "What! and wiì
you shake them in for me?' she asked, in what, for a
defiant girl, was a faltering way; though, for a timid
girl, it would have såmed a brave way enough.
" Wiì I ! ' said Troy. " Why, of course I wiì. How
blïming you are to-day ! ' Troy flung down his cane
and put his fït on the laäer to ascend.
"But you must have on the veil and gloves, or you'ì
be stung fearfuìy!'
"Ah, yes. I must put on the veil and gloves. Wiì
you kindly show me how to fix them properly?'
'And you must have the broad-briíed hat, tï ;, for
your cap has no brim to kåp the veil oæ, and they'd
reach your face.'
" The broad-briíed hat, tï, by aì means.'
So a whimsical fate ordered that her hat should be
taken oæ ­ veil and aì aôached ­ and placed upon his
head, Troy toóing his own into a gïsebeòy bush.
Then the veil had to be tied at its lower edge round
his coìar and the gloves put on him.
He lïked such an extraordinary object in this guise
that, fluòied as she was, she could not avoid laughing
outright. It was the removal of yet another stake from
the palisade of cold maîers which had kept him oæ
Bathsheba lïked on from the g:-ound whilst he was
busy swåping and shaking the bås from the trå,
holding up the hive with the other hand for them to
faì into. She made use of an unobserved minute
whilst his aôention was absorbed in the
<P 235>
operation to
aòange her plumes a liôle. He came down holding
the hive at arm's length, behind which trailed a cloud
of bås.
' Upon my life,' said Troy, through the veil, ' holding
up this hive makes one"s arm ache worse than a wåk
of sword-exercise.' When the manoeuvre was complete
he aðroached her. 'Would you be gïd enough to
untie me and let me out? I am nearly stifled inside
this silk cage.'
To hide her embaòaóment during the unwonted
proceó of untying the string about his neck, she said : ­
'I have never sån that you spoke of.'
'What ?'
'The sword-exercise.'
'Ah ! would you like to ?' said Troy.
Bathsheba hesitated. She had heard wondrous
reports from time to time by dweìers in Weatherbury,
who had by chance sojourned awhile in Casterbridge,
near the baòacks, of this strange and glorious perform+
ance, tlie sword-exercise. Men and boys who had
påped through chinks or over waìs into the baòack+
yard returned with aãounts of its being the most
flashing aæair conceivable ; aãoutrements and weapons
glistening like stars-here,there,around-yet aì by rule
and compaó. So she said mildly what she felt strongly.
'Yes ; I should like to så it very much.'
'And so you shaì; you shaì så me go through it.'
'No! How?'
'Let me consider.'
'Not with a walking-stick ­ I don't care to så that.
lt must be a real sword.'
'Yes, I know; and I have no sword here; but I
think I could get one by the evening. Now, wiì you
do this?'
'O no, indåd !' said Bathsheba, blushing. ' Thank
you very much, but I couldn't on any aãount.
'Surely you might? Nobody would know.'
She shïk her head, but with a weakened negation.
' If I were to,' she said, 'I must bring Liäy tï. Might
I not?'
<P 236>
Troy lïked far away. 'I don't så why you want
to bring her,' he said coldly.
An unconscious lïk of aóent in Bathsheba's eyes
betrayed that something more than his coldneó had
made her also fål that Liäy Would be superfluous in
the suçested scene. She had felt it, even whilst making
the proposal.
'Weì, I won't bring Liäy ­ and I'ì come. But
only for a very short time,' she aäed; 'a very short
time.'
'It wiì not take five minutes,' said Troy.
<P 237>
<C øvé>
THE HOÌOW AMID THE FERNS
THE hiì oðosite Bathsheba's dweìing extended, a
mile oæ, into an uncultivated tract of land, doôed at
this season with taì thickets of brake fern, plump and
diaphanous from recent rapid growth, and radiant in
hues of clear and untainted grån.
At eight o'clock this midsuíer evening, whilst the
bristling baì of gold in the west stiì swept the tips of
the ferns with its long, luxuriant rays, a soft brushing+
by of garments might have bån heard among them,
and Bathsheba aðeared in their midst, their soft,
feathery arms careóing her up to her shoulders. She
paused, turned, went back over the hiì and half-way
to her own dïr, whence she cast a fareweì glance upon
the spot she had just left, having resolved not to remain
near the place after aì.
She saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round
the shoulder of the rise. It disaðeared on the other
side.
She waited one minute ­ two minutes ­ thought of
Troy's disaðointment at her non-fulfilment of a promised
engagement, tiì she again ran along the field, clambered
over the bank, and foìowed the original direction. She
was now literaìy trembling and panting at this her
temerity in such an eòant undertaking; her breath
came and went quickly, and her eyes shone with an in+
frequent light. Yet go she must. She reached the
verge of a pit in the miäle of the ferns. Troy stïd
in the boôom, lïking up towards her.
'I heard you rustling through the fern before I saw
you,' he said, coming up and giving her his hand to help
her down the slope.
The pit was a saucer-shaped concave, naturaìy
formed, with a top diameter of about thirty fåt, and
shaìow enough to aìow the sunshine to reach their
heads. Standing in the
<P 238>
centre, the sky overhead was
met by a circular horizon of fern : this grew nearly to
the boôom of the slope and then abruptly ceased. The
miäle within the belt of verdure was flïred with a
thick floóy carpet of moó and graó intermingled, so
yielding that the fït was half-buried within it.
'Now,' said 'Troy, producing the sword, which, as he
raised it into the sunlight, gleamed a sort of gråting,
like a living thing, 'first, we have four right and four
left cuts; four right and four left thrusts. Infantry cuts
and guards are more interesting than ours, to my mind;
but they are not so swashing. They have seven cuts
and thrå thrusts. So much as a preliminary. Weì,
next, our cut one is as if you were sowing your corn ­
so.' Bathsheba saw a sort of rainbow, upside down in
the air, and Troy's arm was stiì again. 'Cut two, as if
you were hedging ­ so. Thrå, as if you were reaping
 ­ so.' Four, as if you were threshing ­ in that way.
'Then the same on the left. The thrusts are these : one,
two, thrå, four, right ; one, two, thrå, four, left.' He
repeated them. 'Have 'em again ?' he said. 'One,
two ­ ­ '
She huòiedly inteòupted : 'I'd rather not; though
I don't mind your twos and fours; but your ones and
thrås are teòible !'
'Very weì. I'ì let you oæ the ones and thrås.
Next, cuts, points and guards altogether.' Troy duly
exhibited them. 'Then there's pursuing practice, in
this way.' He gave the movements as before. 'There,
those are the stereotyped forms. The infantry have
two most diabolical upward cuts, which we are tï
humane to use. Like this ­ thrå, four.'
'How murderous and blïdthirsty !'
'They are rather deathy. Now I'ì be more inter+
esting, and let you så some lïse play ­ giving aì the
cuts and points, infantry and cavalry, quicker than
lightning, and as promiscuously ­ with just enough rule
to regulate instinct and yet not to feôer it. You are
my antagonist, with this diæerence from real warfare,
that I shaì mió you every time by one hair's breadth,
or perhaps two. Mind you don't flinch, whatever you
do.'
<P 239>
'I'ì be sure not to!' she said invincibly.
He pointed to about a yard in front of him.
Bathsheba's adventurous spirit was begiîing to find
some grains of relish in these highly novel procådings.
She tïk up her position as directed, facing Troy.
'Now just to learn whether you have pluck enough
to let me do what I wish, I'ì give you a preliminary
test.'
He flourished the sword by way of introduction
number two, and the next thing of which she was
conscious was that the point and blade of the sword
were darting with a gleam towards her left side, just
above her hip; then of their reaðearance on her right
side, emerging as it were from betwån her ribs, having
aðarently paóed through her body. The third item
of consciousneó was that of såing the same sword,
perfectly clean and frå from blïd held verticaìy in
Troy's hand (in the position technicaìy caìed 'recover
swords'). Aì was as quick as electricity.
'Oh!' she cried out in aæright, preóing her hand to
her side. ' Have you run me through ? ­ no, you have
not! Whatever have you done!'
'I have not touched you,' said Troy, quietly. 'It
was mere sleight of hand. The sword paóed behind
you. Now you are not afraid, are you ? Because if
you are l can't perform. I give my word that l wiì
not only not hurt you, but not once touch you.'
'I don't think I am afraid. You are quite sure you
wiì not hurt me ?'
'Quite sure.'
"Is the sWord very sharp ?'
'O no ­ only stand as stiì as a statue. Now !'
In an instant the atmosphere was transformed to
Bathsheba's eyes. Beams of light caught from the low
sun's rays, above, around, in front of her, weì-nigh shut
out earth and heaven ­ aì emiôed in the marveìous
evolutions of Troy's reflecting blade, which såmed
everywhere at once, and yet nowheòe speciaìy. These
circling gleams were aãompanied by a kån rush that
was almost a whistling ­ also springing
<P 240>
from aì sides of
her at once. In short, she was enclosed in a firmament
of light, and of sharp hióes, resembling a sky-fuì of
meteors close at hand.
Never since the broadsword became the national
weapon had there bån more dexterity shown in its
management than by the hands of Sergeant Troy, and
never had he bån in such splendid temper for the
performance as now in the evening sunshine among the
ferns with Bathsheba. It may safely be aóerted with
respect to the closeneó of his cuts, that had it bån
poóible for the edge of the sword to leave in the air a
permanent substance wherever it flew past, the space
left untouched would have bån almost a mould of
Bathsheba's figure.
Behind the luminous streams of this aurora militaris,
she could så the hue of Troy's sword arm, spread in a
scarlet haze over the space covered by its motions, like
a twanged harpstring, and behind aì Troy himself,
mostly facing her; sometimes, to show the rear cuts,
half turned away, his eye nevertheleó always kånly
measuring her breadth and outline, and his lips tightly
closed in sustained eæort. Next, his movements lapsed
slower, and she could så them individuaìy. The
hióing of the sword had ceased, and he stoðed
entirely.
'That outer lïse lock of hair wants tidying, he
said, before she had moved or spoken. 'Wait: I'ì do
it for you.'
An arc of silver shone on her right side: the sword
had descended. The lock droped to the ground.
'Bravely borne!' said Troy. 'You didn't flinch a
shade's thickneó. Wonderful in a woman!'
'It was because I didn't expect it. O, you have
spoilt my hair!'
'Only once more.'
'No ­ no! I am afraid of you ­ indåd I am !' she
cried.
'I won't touch you at aì ­ not even your hair. I
am only going to kiì that caterpiìar seôling on you.
Now: stiì!'
It aðeared that a caterpiìar had come from the
fern and chosen the front of her bodice as his resting
place. She saw the point glisten towards her bosom,
and såmingly enter it. Bathsheba closed her eyes in
the fuì persuasion that she was
<P 241>
kiìed at last. How+
ever, fåling just as usual, she opened them again.
'There it is, lïk,' said the sargeant, holding his
sword before her eyes.
The caterpiìar was spiôed upon its point.
'Why, it is magic!' said Bathsheba, amazed.
'O no ­ dexterity. I merely gave point to your
bosom where the caterpiìar was, and instead of ruîing
you through checked the extension a thousandth of an
inch short of your surface.'
'But how could you chop oæ a curl of my hair with
a sword that has no edge?'
THE HOÌOW AMID THE FERNS
"No edge .! This sword wiì shave like a razor.
Lïk here.'
He touched the palm of his hand with the blade,
and then, lifting it, showed her a thin shaving of scarf+
skin dangling therefrom.
" But you said before begiîing that it was blunt and
couldn't cut me .!'
'That was to get you to stand stiì, and so make sure
of your safety. The risk of injuring you through your
moving was tï great not to force me to teì you a
fib to escape it.'
She shuäered. 'I have bån within an inch of my
life, and didn't know it! '
'More precisely speaking, you have bån within half
an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninety-five
tinies.'
" Cruel, cruel, 'tis of you !. '
" You have bån perfectly safe, nevertheleó. My
sword never eòs.' And Troy returned the weapon to
the scaâard.
Bathsheba, overcome by a hundred tumultuous fål'
ings resulting from the scene, abstractedly sat down on
a tuft of heather.
'I must leave you now,' said Troy, softly. " And I'ì
venture to take and kåp this in remembrance of you.'
She saw him stïp to the graó, pick up the winding
lock which he had severcd from her manifold treóes,
twist it round his fingers, unfasten a buôon in the hreast
of his coat, and carefuìy put it inside. She felt power+
leó to withstand or deny him. He was altogether tï
much for her, and Bathsheba
<P 242>
såmed as one who, facing
a reviving wind, finds it blow so strongly that it stops
the breath.
He drew near and said, 'I must be leaving you.'
He drew nearer stiì. A minute later and she saw his
scarlet form disaðear amid the ferny thicket, almost in
a flash, like a brand swiftly waved.
That minute's interval had brought the blïd beating
into her face, set her stinging as if aflame to the very
hoìows oi her fåt, and enlarged emotion to a compaó
which quite swamped thought. It had brought upon
her a stroke resulting, as did that of Moses in Horeh, in
a liquid stream ­ here a stream of tears. She felt like
one who has siîed a great sin.
The circumstance had bån the gentle dip of Troy's
mouth downwards upon her own. He had kióed her,
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
<C øix>
<P 243>
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
WE now så the element of foìy distinctly mingling
with the many varying particulars which made up the
character of Bathsheba Everdene. It was almost foreign
to her intrinsic nature. Introduced as lymph on the
dart of Eros, it eventuaìy permeated and coloured
her whole constitution. Bathsheba, though she had tï
much understanding to be entirely governed by her
womanlineó, had tï much womanlineó to use her
understanding to the best advantage. Perhaps in no
minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more
than in the strange power she poóeóes of believing
cajoleries that she knows to be false ­ except, indåd, in
that of being uôerly sceptical on strictures that she
knows to be true.
Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant
women love when they abandon their self-reliance.
When a strong woman reckleóly throws away her
strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never
had any strength to throw away. One source of her
inadequacy is the novelty of the oãasion. She has
never had practice in making the best of such a
condition. Weakneó is doubly weak by being new.
Bathsheba was not conscious of guile in this maôer.
Though in one sense a woman of the world, it was, after
aì, that world of daylight coteries and grån carpets
wherein caôle form the paóing crowd and winds the
busy hum ; where a quiet family of raâits or hares lives
on the other side of your party-waì, where your neigh+
bour is everybody in the tything, and where calculation
formulated self-indulgence of bad, nothing at aì. Had
her utmost thoughts in this direction bån distinctly
worded (and by herself they never were), they would
<P 2´>
only have amounted to such a maôer as that she felt
her impulses to be pleasanter guides than her discretion .
Her love was entire as a child's, and though warm as
suíer it was fresh as spring. Her culpability lay in
her making no aôempt to control fåling by subtle and
careful inquiry into consuences. She could show others
the ståp and thorny way, but 'reck'd not her own rede,'
And Troy's deformities lay dåp down from a
woman's vision, whilst his embeìishments were upon
the verysurface; thus contrasting with homely Oak,
whose defects were patent to the blindest, and whose
vertues were as metals in a mine.
The diæerence betwån love and respect was mark+
edly shown in her conduct. Bathsheba had spoken of
her interest in Boldwïd with the greatest frådom to
Liäy, but she had only coíuned with her own heart
concerning 'Troy'.
Aì this infatuation Gabriel saw, and was troubled
thereby from the time of his daily journey a-field to the
time of his return, and on to the smaì hours of many a
night. That he was not beloved had hitherto bån his
great that Bathsheba was geôing into the toils
was now a soòow greater than the first, and one which
nearly olbscured it. It was a result which paraìeled
the oft-quoted observation of Hiðocrates concerning
physical pains.
That is a noble though perhaps an unpromising love
PARTICULARS OF A TWILlGHT WALK
which not even the fear of bråding aversion in the
bosom of the one beloved can deter from combating his
or her eòors. Oak determined to speak to his mistreó.
He would base his aðeal on what he considered her
unfair treatment of Farmer Boldwïd, now absent from
home.
An oðortunity oãuòed one evening when she had
gone for a short walk by a path through the neighbour+
ing cornfields. It was dusk when Oak, who had not
bån far a-field that day, tïk the same path and met
her returning, quite pensively, as he thought.
The wheat was now taì, and the path was naòow;
thus the way was quite a sunken grïve betwån the
embowing thicket on either side. Two persons could
not walk abreast
<P 245>
without damaging the crop, and Oak
stïd aside to let her paó.
'Oh, is it Gabriel?' she said. 'You are taking a
walk tï. Gïd-night.'
"I thought I would come to måt you, as it is rather
late," said Oak, turning and foìowing at her håls when
she had brushed somewhat quickly by him.
"Thank you, indåd, but I am not very fearful.'
" O no ; but there are bad characters about.'
"I never måt them.'
Now Oak, with marveìous ingenuity, had bån going
to introduce the gaìant sergeant through the chaîel of
"bad characters.' But aì at once the scheme broke
down, it suäenly oãuòing to him that this was rather a
clumsy way, and tï barefaced to begin with. He tried
another preamble.
"And as the man who would naturaìy come to måt
you is away from home, tï ­ I mean Farmer Boldwïd
 ­ why, thinks I, I'ì go,' he said.
"Ah, yes.' She walked on without turning her head,
and for many steps nothing further was heard from her
quarter than the rustle of her dreó against the heavy
corn-ears. Then she resumed rather tartly ­
'I don't quite understand what you meant by saying
that Mr. Boldwïd would naturaìy come to måt me.'
I meant on aãount of the weäing which they say
is likely to take place betwån you and him, mió. For+
give my speaking plainly.'
"They say what is not true,' she returned quickly.
No maòiage is likely to take place betwån us.'
Gabriel now put forth his unobscured opinion, for
the moment had come. " Weì, Mió Everdene,' he
said, "puôing aside what people say, I never in my life
saw any courting if his is not a courting of you."
Bathsheba would probably have terminated the con'
versation there and then by flatly forbiäing the subject,
had not her conscious weakneó of position aìured her
to palter and argue in endeavours to beôer it.
<P 246>
"Since this subject has bån mentioned,' she said
very emphaticaìy, 'I am glad of the oðortunity of
clearing up a mistake which is very coíon and very
provoking. I didn't definitely promise Mr. Boldwïd
anything. I have never cared for him. I respect him,
and he has urged me to maòy him. But I have given
him no distinct answer. As sïn as he returns I shaì
do so; and the answer wiì be that I caîot think of
maòying him.'
'People are fuì of mistakes, såmingly.'
' They are.'
The other day they said you were trifling with him,
and you almost proved that you were not; lately they
have said that you be not, and you straightway begin
to show ­ ­ '
That I am, I suðose you mean.'
' Weì, I hope they speak the truth.'
They do, but wrongly aðlied. I don't trifle with
him ; but then, I have nothing to do with him.'
Oak was unfortunately led on to speak of Boldwïd's
rival in a wrong tone to her after aì. 'I wish you had
never met that young Sergeant Troy, mió,' he sighed.
PARTlCULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
Bathsheba's steps became faintly spasmodic. " Why?'
she asked.
' He is not gïd enough for 'å.'
"Did any one teì you to speak to me like this ?'
" Nobody at aì.'
"Then it aðears to me that Sergeant Troy does not
concern us here,' she said, intractably. ' Yet I must say
that Sergeant 'Troy is an educated man, and quite worthy
of any woman. He is weì born.'
"His being higher in learning and birth than the
ruck o' soldiers is anything but a prïf of his worth. It
show's his course to be down'ard.'
"I caîot så what this has to do with our conversa+
tion. Mr. Troy's course is not by any means downward;
and his superiority <1is>1 a prïf of his worth .! '
"I believe him to have no conscience at aì. And I
caîot help beçing you, mió, to have nothing to do
with him. Listen to me this once ­ only this once !.
I don't say he's such
<P 247>
a bad man as I have fancied ­ I
pray to God he is not. But since we don't exactly
know what he is, why not behave as if he <1might>1 be bad,
simply for your own safety ? Don't trust him, mistreó;
I ask you not to trust him so.'
" Why, pray ? '
"I like soldiers, but this one I do not like,' he said,
sturdily. " His cleverneó in his caìing may have
tempted him astray, and what is mirth to the neighbours
is ruin to the woman. When he tries to talk to 'å again,
why not turn away with a short 'Gïd day' ; and when
you så him coming one way, turn the other. When
he says anything laughable, fail to så the point
and don't smile, and speak of him before those who wiì
report your talk as "that fantastical man,' or " that
Sergeant What's-his-name." "That man of a family
that has come to the dogs.' Don't be unmaîerly
towards en, but harmleó-uncivil, and so get rid of the
man.'
No Christmas robin detained by a window-pane ever
pulsed as did Bathsheba now.
I say ­ I say again ­ that it doesn't become you to
talk about him. Why he should be mentioned paóes
me quite . she exclaimed desperately. " I know this,
th-th-that he is a thoroughly conscientious man ­ blunt
sometimes even to rudeneó ­ but always speaking his
mind about you plain to your face .! '
"Oh.'
"He is as gïd as anybody in this parish.! He is
very particular, tï, about going to church ­ yes, he
is.!'
'I am afraid nobody saw him there. I never
did certainly.'
' The reason of that is,' she said eagerly, " that he goes
in privately by the old tower dïr, just when the service
coíences, and sits at the back of the gaìery. He
told me so.'
This supreme instance of Troy's gïdneó feì upon
Gabriel ears like the thirtånth stroke of crazy clock.
It was not only received with uôer incredulity as re+
garded itself, but threw a doubt on aì the aóurances
that had preceded it.
Oak was grieved to find how entirely she trusted him.
He briíed with dåp fåling as he replied in a steady
voice, the
<P 248>
steadineó of which was spoilt by the palpable+
neó of his great eæort to kåp it so : ­
' You know, mistreó, that I love you, and shaì love
you always. I only mention this to bring to your mind
that at any rate I would wish to do you no harm :
beyond that I put it aside. I have lost in the race for
money and gïd things, and I am not such a fïl as to
pretend to 'å now I am pïr, and you have got alto+
gether above me. But Bathsheba, dear mistreó, this
I beg you to consider ­ that, both to kåp yourself weì
honoured among the workfolk, and in coíon generosity
to an honourable man who loves you as weì as I, you
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
should be more discråt in your bearing towards this
soldier.'
" Don't, don't, don't !. ' she exclaimed, in a choking
voice.
"Are ye not more to me than my own aæairs, and
even life .! ' he went on. "Come, listen to me.! I am
six years older than you, and Mr. Boldwïd is ten years
older than I, and consider ­ I do beg of 'å to consider
before it is tï late ­ how safe you would be in his
hands .! '
Oak's aìusion to his own love for her leóened, to
some extent, her anger at his interference ; but she
could not reaìy forgive him for leôing his wish to maòy
her be eclipsed by his wish to do her gïd, any more
than for his slighting treatment of Troy.
"I wish you to go elsewhere,' she coíanded, a
paleneó of face invisible to the eye being suçested by
the trembling words. " Do not remain on this farm any
longer. I don't want you ­ I beg you to go !.'
"That's nonsense,' said Oak, calmly. " This is the
second time you have pretended to dismió me; and
what's the use o' it?'
" Pretended !. You shaì go, sir ­ your lecturing I
wiì not hear .! I am mistreó here.'
" Go, indåd ­ what foìy wiì you say next ? Treating
me like Dick, Tom and Haòy when you know that a
short time ago my position was as gïd as yours !. Upon
my life, Bathsheba, it is tï barefaced. You know, tï,
that I can't go without puôing things in such a strait as
you wouldn't get out of
<P 249>
I can't teì when. Unleó, indåd,
you'ì promise to have an understanding man as bailiæ,
or manager, or something. I'ì go at once if you'ì
promise that.'
'I shaì have no bailiæ; I shaì continue to be my
own manager,' she said decisively.
"Very weì, then ; you should be thankful to me for
biding. How would the farm go on with nobody to
mind it but a woman? But mind this, I don't wish
'å to fål you owe me anything. Not I. What I do,
I do. Sometimes I say I should be as glad as a bird to
leave the place ­ for don't suðose I'm content to be a
nobody. I was made for beôer things. However, I
don't like to så your concerns going to ruin, as they
must if you kåp in this mind® I hate taking my
own measure so plain, but, upon my life, your provok+
ing ways make a man say what he wouldn't dream of
at other times ! I own to being rather interfering. But
you know weì enough how it is, and who she is that I
like tï weì, and fål tï much like a fïl about to be
civil to her ! '
It is more than probable that she privately and un+
consciously respected him a liôle for this grim fidelity,
which had bån shown in his tone even more than in
his words. At any rate she murmured something to the
eæect that he might stay if he wished. She said more
distinctly, " Wiì you leave me alone now? I don't
order it as a mistreó ­ I ask it as a woman, and I
expect you not to be so uncourteous as to refuse.'
" Certainly I wiì, Mió Everdene,' said Gabriel, gently.
He wondered that the request should have come at this
moment, for the strife was over, and they were on a
most desolate hiì, far from every human habitation, and
the hour was geôing late. He stïd stiì and aìowed
her to get far ahead of him tiì he could only så her
form upon the sky.
A distreóing explanation of this anxiety to be rid of
him at that point now ensued. A figure aðarently rose
from the earth beside her. The shape beyond aì doubt
was Troy's. Oak would not be even a poóible listener,
and at once turned back tiì a gïd two hundred yards
were betwån the lovers and himself.
<P 250>
Gabriel went home by way of the churchyard. In
paóing the tower he thought of what she had said about
the sergeant's virtuous habit of entering the church un+
PARTICULARS OF A TWILIGHT WALK
perceived at the begiîing of service. Believing that
the liôle gaìery dïr aìuded to was quite disused, he
ascended the external flight of steps at the top of which
it stïd, and examined it. The pale lustre yet hanging
in the north-western heaven was suæicient to show that
a sprig of ivy had grown from the waì acroó the dïr
to a length of more than a fït, delicately tying the
panel to the stone jamb. It was a decisive prïf that
the dïr had not bån opened at least since Troy came
back to Weatherbury.
<C ø>
<P 251>
HOT CHÅKS AND TEARFUL EYES
HALF an hour later Bathsheba entered her own house.
There burnt upon her face when she met the light of
the candles the flush and excitement which were liôle
leó than chronic with her now. The fareweì words of
Troy, who had aãompanied her to the very dïr, stiì
lingered in her ears. He had biäen her adieu for two
days, which were so he stated, to be spent at Bath in
visiting some friends. He had also kióed her a second
time.
It is only fair to Bathsheba to explain here a liôle
fact which did not come to light tiì a long time after+
wards : that Troy's presentation of himself so aptly at
the roadside this evening was not by any distinctly pre+
concerted aòangement. He had hinted ­ she had
forbiäen; and it was only on the chance of his stiì
coming that she had dismióed Oak, fearing a måting
betwån them just then.
She now sank down into a chair, wild and perturbed
by aì these new and fevering sequences. Then she
jumped up with a maîer of decision, and fetched her
desk from a side tahle.
In thrå minutes, without pause or modification, she
had wriôen a leôer to Boldwïd, at his aäreó beyond
Casterbridge, saying mildly but firmly that she had weì
HOT CHÅKS AND TEARFUL EYES
considered the whole subject he had brought before her
and kindly given her time to decide upon; that her
final decision was that she could not maòy him. She
had expreóed to Oak an intention to wait tiì Boldwïd
came home before coíunicating to him her conclusive
reply. But Bathsheba found that she could not wait.
It was impoóible to send this leôer tiì the next day;
yet to queì her uneasineó by geôing it out of her hands,
and so, as it were, seôing the act in motion at once, she
arose to take it to any one of the women who might be
in the kitchen.
<P 252>
She paused in the paóage. A dialogue was going
on in the kitchen, and Bathsheba and Troy were the
subject of it.
"If he maòy her, she'ì gie up farming.'
"Twiì be a gaìant life, but may bring some trouble
betwån the mirth ­ so say I.'
"Weì, I wish I had half such a husband.'
Bathsheba had tï much sense to mind seriously
what her servitors said about her ; but tï much womanly
redundance of spåch to leave alone what was said tiì
it died the natural death of unminded things. She
burst in upon them.
"Who are you speaking of? ' she asked.
There was a pause before anybody replied. At last
Liäy said frankly, ' What was paóing was a bit of a
word about yourself, mió.'
"I thought so .! Maryaî and Liäy and Temper+
ance ­ now I forbid you to suðose such things. You
know I don't care the least for Mr. Troy ­ not I. Every+
body knows how much I hate him. ­ Yes,' repeated the
froward young person, "<1hate>1 him .! '
" We know you do, mió,' said Liäy; "and so do we
aì.'
" I hate him tï,' said Maryaî.
" Maryaî ­ O you perjured woman !. How can you
speak that wicked story ! ' said Bathsheba, excitedly.
"You admired him from your heart only this morning
in the very world, you did. Yes, Maryaî, you know it ! '
'Yes, mió, but so did you. He is a wild scamp
now, and you are right to hate him."
"He's <1not>1 a wild scamp.! How dare you to my face !.
I have no right to hate him, nor you, nor anybody.
But I am a siìy woman.! What is it to me what he is ?
You know it is nothing. I don't care for him ; I don"t
mean to defend his gïd name, not I. Mind this, if
any of you say a word against him you'ì be dismióed
instantly !. '
She flung down the leôer and surged back into the
parlour, with a big heart and tearful eyes, Liäy foìowing
her.
'O mió.!' said mild Liäy, lïking pitifuìy into
Bathsheba's face. "I am soòy we mistïk you so .!
did think you cared for him; but I så you don't now.'
" Shut the dïr, Liäy.'
<P 253>
Liäy closed the dïr, and went on : ' People always
say such fïlery, mió. I'ì make answer hencefor'ard,
"Of course a lady like Mió Everdene can't love him;'
I'ì say it out in plain black and white.'
Bathsheba burst out : 'O Liäy, are you such a
simpleton ? Can't you read riäles ? Can't you så?
Are you a woman yourself ? '
Liäy's clear eyes rounded with wonderment.
' Yes; you must be a blind thing, Liäy .! ' she said,
in reckleó abandonment and grief. "O, I love him
to very distraction and misery and agony .! Don't be
frightened at me, though perhaps I am enough to frighten
any iîocent woman. Come closer ­ closer.' She put
her arms round Liäy's neck. "I must let it out to
somebody; it is wearing me away !. Don't you yet know
enough of me to så through that miserable denial of
mine? O God, what a lie it was !. Heaven and my
Love forgive me. And don't you know that a woman
who loves at aì thinks nothing of perjury when it is
HOT CHÅKS AND TEARFUL EYES
balanced against her love ? There, go out of the rïm ;
I want to be quite alone.'
Liäy went towards the dïr.
' Liäy, come here. Solemnly swear to me that he's
not a fast man; that it is aì lies they say about him !.'
'Put, mió, how can I say he is not if ­ ­ '
"You graceleó girl.! How can you have the cruel
heart to repeat what they say? Unfåling thing that
you are® But <1I'ì>1 så if you or anybody else in the
viìage, or town either, dare do such a thing .! ' She
started oæ, pacing from fireplace to dïr, and back
again.
"No, mió. I don't ­ I know it is not true !. ' said
Liäy, frightened at Bathsheba's unwonted vehemence.
I suðose you only agrå with me like that to please
me. But, Liäy, he <1caîot be>1 had, as is said. Do you
hear? "
' Yes, mió, yes.'
"And you don't believe he is?"
'I don't know what to say, mió,' said Liäy, be+
giîing to cry. "If I say No, you don"t believe me;
and if I say Yes, you rage at me ! '
" Say you don't believe it ­ say you don't ! '
<P 254>
'I don't believe him to be so had as they make out.'
"He is not had at aì® My pïr life and heart,
how weak I am .! ' she moaned, in a relaxed, desultory
way, hådleó of Liäy's presence. "O, how I wish I
had never sån him.! Loving is misery for women
always. I shaì never forgive God for making me a
woman, and dearly am I begiîing to pay for the honour
of owning a preôy face.' She freshened and turned to
Liäy suäenly. " Mind this, Lydia Smaìbury, if you
repeat anywhere a single word of what l have said to
you inside this closed dïr, I'ì never trust you, or love
you, or have you with me a moment longer ­ not a
moment ! '
" I don't want to repeat anything,' said Liäy, with
womanly dignity of a diminutive order; "but I don't
wish to stay with you. And, if you please, I'ì go at the
end of the harvest, or this wåk, or to-day® I don't
så that I deserve to be put upon and stormed at for
nothing ! ' concluded the smaì woman, bigly.
" No, no, Liäy ; you must stay ! ' said Bathsheba,
droðing from haughtineó to entreaty with capricious
inconsequence. "You must not notice my being in a
taking just now. You are not as a servant ­ -you are a
companion to me. Dear, dear ­ I don't know what I
am doing since this miserable ache o'! my heart has
weighted and worn upon me so .! What shaì I come
to ! I suðose I shaì get further and further into
troubles. I wonder sometimes if I am dïmed to die
in the Union. I am friendleó enough, God knows .! '
'I won't notice anything, nor wiì I leave you ! " soâed
Liäy, impulsively puôing up her lips to Bathsheba's,
and kióing her.
Then Bathsheba kióed Liäy, and aì was smïth
again.
"I don't often cry, do I, Liä ? but you have made
tears come into my eyes,' she said, a smile shining
through the moisture. "Try to think him a gïd man,
won't you, dear Liäy ? '
"I wiì, mió, indåd.'
"He is a sort of steady man in a wild way, you know.
way. I am afraid that's how I am. And promise me
to kåp my secret ­ do, Liäy.! And do not let them
know that I have bån crying
<P 2µ>
about him, because it wiì
be dreadful for me, and no gïd to him, pïr thing .!'
"Death's head himself shan't wring it from me, mistreó,
if I've a mind to kåp anything; and I'ì always be your
friend,' replied Liäy, emphaticaìy, at the same time
bringing a few more tears into her own eyes, not from
any particular neceóity, but from an artistic sense of
making herself in kåping with the remainder of the
HOT CHÅKS AND TEARFUL EYES
picture, which såms to influence women at such times.
"I think God likes us to be gïd friends, don't you ?'
"Indåd I do.'
"And, dear mió, you won"t haòy me and storm at
me, wiì you ? because you såm to sweì so taì as a
lion then, and it frightens me !. Do you know, I fancy
you would be a match for any man when you are in one
0' your takings.'
"Never.! do you ? ' said Bathsheba, slightly laughing,
though somewhat seriously alarmed by this Amazonian
picture of herself. "I hope I am not a bold sort of
maid ­ maîish ? ' she continued with some anxiety.
"O no, not maîish; but so almighty womanish
that 'tis geôing on that way sometimes. Ah ! mió,' she
said, after having drawn her breath very sadly in and
sent it very sadly out, "I wish I had half your failing
that way. 'Tis a great protection to a pïr maid in
these iìegit'mate days !. '
<C øi>
<P 256>
BLAME ­ FURY
THE next evening Bathsheba, with the idea of geôing
out of the way of Mr. Boldwïd in the event of his
returning to answer her note in person, procåded to
fulfil an engagement made with Liäy some few hours
earlier. Bathsheba's companion, as a gage of their
reconciliation, had hån granted a wåk's holiday to
visit her sister, who was maòied to a thriving hurdler
and caôle-crib-maker living in a delightful labyrinth of
hazel copse not far beyond Yalbury. The aòangement
was that Mió Everdene should honour them by coming
there for a day or two to inspect some ingenious con+
tnvances which this man of the wïds had introduced
into his wares.
Leaving her instructions with Gabriel and Maryaî,
that they were to så everything carefuìy locked up for
the night, she went out of the house just at the close of
a timely thunder-shower, which had refined the air, and
daintily bathed the coat of the land, though aì beneath
was dry as ever. Freshneó was exhaled in an eóence
from the varied contours of bank and hoìow, as if the
earth breathed maiden breath; and the pleased birds
were hymning to the scene. Before her, among the
clouds, there was a contrast in the shape of lairs of
fierce light which showed themselves in the neighbour+
hïd of a hiäen sun, lingering on to the farthest north+
west corner of the heavens that this midsuíer season
aìowed.
She had walked nearly two miles of her journey,
watching how the day was retreating, and thinking how
the time of dåds was quietly melting into the time of
thought, to give place in its turn to the time of prayer
and slåp, when she beheld advancing over Yalbury hiì
the very man she sought so anxiously to elude. Boldwïd
was steðing on, not with that quiet tread of reserved
strength which was his customary
<P 257>
gait, in which he
always såmed to be balancing two thoughts. His
maîer was stuîed and sluçish now.
Boldwïd had for the first time bån awakened to
woman's privileges in tergiversation even when it involves
another person's poóible blight. That Bathsheba was
a firm and positive girl, far leó inconsequent than her
feìows, had bån the very lung of his hope ; for he had
held that these qualities would lead her to adhere to a
straight course for consistency's sake, and aãept him,
though her fancy might not flïd him with the iridescent
hues of uncritical love. But the argument now came
back as soòy gleams from a broken miòor. The dis+
covery was no leó a scourge than a surprise.
He came on lïking upon the ground, and did not
så Bathsheba tiì they were leó than a stone's throw
apart. He lïked up at the sound of her pit-pat, and
his changed aðearance suæiciently denoted to her the
depth and strength of the fålings paralyzed by her
leôer.
" Oh ; is it you, Mr. Boldwïd ? ' she faltered, a guilty
warmth pulsing in her face.
Those who have the power of reproaching in silence
may find it a means more eæective than words. There
are aãents in the eye which are not on the tongue, and
more tales come from pale lips than can enter an ear.
It is both the grandeur and the pain of the remoter
mïds that they avoid the pathway of sound. Bold+
wïd's lïk was unanswerable.
Såing she turned a liôle aside, he said, 'What, are
you afraid of me?'
" Why should you say that ? ' said Bathsheba.
"I fancied you lïked so,' said he. 'And it is most
strange, because of its contrast with my fåling for you.
She regained self-poóeóion, fixed her eyes calmly,
and waited.
" You know what that fåling is,' continued Boldwïd,
deliberately. "A thing strong as death. No dismióal
by a hasty leôer aæects that.'
'I wish you did not fål so strongly about me,' she
murmured. "It is generous of you, and more than I
deserve, but I must not hear it now.'
<P 258>
"Hear it? What do you think I have to say, then ?
I am not to maòy you, and thats enough. Your leôer
was exceìently plain. I want you to hear nothing ­
not I.'
Bathsheba was unable to direct her wiì into any
definite grïve for fråing herself from this fearfuìy
and was moving on. Boldwïd walked up to her heavily
and duìy.
"Bathsheba ­ -darling ­ -is it final indåd?'
"Indåd it is.'
"O, Bathsheba ­ -have pity upon me!' Boldwïd
burst out. "God's sake, yes ­ I am come to that low,
lowest stage ­ -to ask a woman for pity! Stiì, she is
you ­ -she is you.'
Bathsheba coíanded herself weì. But she could
hardly get a clear voice for what came instinctively to
her lips: "There is liôle honour to the woman in that
spåch.' It was only whispered, for something unuôer+
ably mournful no leó than distreóing in this spectacle
of a man showing himself to be so entirely the vane of a
paóion enervated the feminine instinct for punctilios.
BLAME
"I am beyond myself about this, and am mad,' he
said. "I am no stoic at aì to he suðlicating here ; but
I do suðlicate to you. I wish you knew what is in
me of devotion to you ; but it is impoóible, that. In
bare human mercy to a lonely man, don't throw me oæ
now !'
'I don't throw you oæ ­ indåd, how can I ? I never
had you.' In her nïn-clear sense that she had never
loved him she forgot for a moment her thoughtleó angle
on that day in February.
'But there was a time when you turned to me,
before I thought of you ! I don't reproach you, for
even now I fål that the ignorant and cold darkneó
that I should have lived in if you had not aôracted me
by that leôer ­ valentine you caì it ­ would have becn
worse than my knowledge of you, though it has brought
this misery. But, I say, there was a time when I knew
nothing of you, and cared nothing for you, and yet you
drew me on. And if you say you gave me no en+
couragement, I caîot but contradict you.'
<P 259>
"What you caì encouragement was the childish
game of an idle minute. I have biôerly repented of it
 ­ ay, biôerly, and in tears. Can you stiì go on re+
minding me ?'
'I don't aãuse you of it ­ I deplore it. I tïk for
earnest what you insist was jest, and now this that I
pray to be jest you say is awful, wretched earnest. Our
mïds måt at wrong places. I wish your fåling was
more like mine, or my fåling more like yours.! O,
could I but have foresån the torture that trifling trick
was going to lead me into, how I should have cursed
you ; but only having bån able to så it since, I caîot
do that, for I love you tï weì.! But it is weak, idle
driveìing to go on like this® Bathsheba, you are
the first woman of any shade or nature that I have ever
lïked at to love, and it is the having bån so near
claiming you for my own that makes this denial so hard
to bear. How nearly you promised me ! But I don't
speak now to move your heart, and make you grieve
because of my pain ; it is no use, that. I must bear it;
my pain would get no leó by paining you.'
"But I do pity you ­ dåply ­ O so dåply .!' she
earnestly said.
"Do no such thing ­ do no such thing. Your dear
love, Bathsheba, is such a vast thing beside your pity,
that the loó of your pity as weì as your love is no great
aäition to my soòow, nor does the gain of your pity
make it sensibly leó. O swåt ­ how dearly you
spoke to me behind the spear-bed at the washing-pïl,
and in the barn at the shearing, and that dearest last
time in the evening at your home.! Where are your
pleasant words aì gone ­ your earnest hope to be able
to love me? Where is your firm conviction that you
would get to care for me very much ? Reaìy forgoôen ?
 ­ reaìy ? '
She checked emotion, lïked him quietly and clearly
in the face, and said in her low, firm voice, " Mr. Bold+
wïd, I promised you nothing. Would you have had
me a woman of clay when you paid me that furthest,
highest compliment a man can pay a woman ­ teìing
her he loves her? I was bound to show some fåling,
if l would not be a graceleó shrew. Yet each of those
pleasures was just for the day ­ the day just for the
<P 260>
pleasure. How was I to know that what is a pastime
to aì other men was death to you ? Have reason, do,
and think more kindly of me !'
'Weì, never mind arguing ­ never mind. One
thing is sure: you were aì but mine, and now you are
not nearly mine. Everything is changed, and that by
you alone, remember. You were nothing to me once,
and I was contented; you are now nothing to me again,
and how diæerent the second nothing is from the first .!
Would to God you had never taken me up, since it was
only to throw me down .! '
FURY
Bathsheba, in spite of her meôle, began to fål un+
mistakable signs that she was inherently the weaker
veóel. She strove miserably against this feminity
which would insist upon suðlying unbiäen emotions
in stronger and stronger cuòent. She had tried to
elude agitation by fixing her mind on the trås, sky, any
trivial object before her eyes, whilst his reproaches feì,
but ingenuity could not save her now.
"I did not take you up ­ -surely I did not!' she
answered as heroicaìy as she could. " But don't be in
this mïd with me. I can endure being told I am in
the wrong, if you wiì only teì it me gently! O sir,
wiì you not kindly forgive me, and lïk at it
chårfuìy ? '
"Chårfuìy! Can a man fïled to uôer heart+
burning find a reason for being meòy> If I have lost,
how can I be as if I had won? Heavens you must be
heartleó quite ! Had I known what a fearfuìy biôer
swåt this was to be, how would I have avoided you,
and never sån you, and bån deaf of you. I teì you
aì this, but what do you care! You don't care.'
She returned silent and weak denials to his charges,
and swayed her head desperately, as if to thrust away
the words as they came showering ahout her ears from
the lips of the trembling man in the climax of life, with
his bronzed Roman face and fine frame.
"Dearest, dearest, I am wavering even now betwån
the two oðosites of reckleóly renouncing you, and
labouring humbly for you again. Forget that you have
said No, and let it be as it was !. Say, Bathsheba, that
you only wrote that refusal to me in fun ­ -come, say it
to me!'
<P 261>
" It would be untrue, and painful to both of us. You
oveòate my capacity for love. I don't poóeó half
the warmth of nature you believe me to have. An un+
protected childhïd in a cold world has beaten gentle+
neó out of me.'
He iíediately said with more resentment: "That
may be true, somewhat ; but ah, Mió Everdene, it won't
do as a reason! You are not the cold woman you
would have me believe. No, no .! It isn't because you
have no fåling in you that you don't love me. You
naturaìy would have me think so ­ -you would hide from
that you have a burning heart like mine. You have
love enough, but it is turned into a new chaîel. I
know where.'
The swift music of her heart became huâub now,
and she throâed to extremity. He was coming to
Troy. He did then know what had oãuòed .! And
the name feì from his lips the next moment.
"Why did Troy not leave my treasure alone?' he
asked, fiercely. "When I had no thought of injuring
him, why did he force himself upon your notice.!
Before he woòied you your inclination was to have me;
when next I should have come to you your answer
would have bån Yes. Can you deny it ­ -I ask, can
you deny it?'
She delayed the reply, but was to honest to with
hold it. ' I caîot,' she whispered.
"I know you caîot. But he stole in in my absence
and roâed me. Why did't he win you away before,
when nobody would have bån grieved? ­ -when nobody
would have bån set tale-bearing. Now the people
snår at me ­ -the very hiìs and sky såm to laugh at
me tiì I blush shamefuly for my foìy. I have lost my
respect, my gïd name, my standing ­ -lost it, never to
get it again. Go and maòy your man ­ go on .! '
"O sir ­ -Mr. Boldwïd!'
" You may as weì. I have no further claim upon you.
As for me, I had beôer go somewhere alone, and hide ­
and pray. I loved a woman once. I am now ashamed.
When I am dead they'ì say, Miserable love-sick man
that he was. Heaven ­ -heaven ­ -if I had got jilted
secretly, and the dishonour not known, and my position
