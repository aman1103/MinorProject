standard for mail headers - RFC8² poóibly, but X.4° is more likely.
Until that glorious day aòives (if it ever does), mailers at the mail
'gateways' betwån networks wiì have liôle option but to munge
aäreóes because of incompatible mail headers and aäreóing formats.ŠWhat you mail system should do is rewrite mail headers into the
aðropriate form for transmióion to a given host. In short, if your
õcp neighbours only understand bang-style aäreóes, you mailer should
only present bang-style paths to these sites. If some sites understand
RFC8² (user@host.domain), then you should send them RFC8² style mail.
What would be leó easy for the mailer is separating your bang-stlye
õcp neighbours from those who understand RFC8².ŠThe best mailers (ÍDF or sendmail - no flames please!) take an input
aäreó, convert it to a canonical form and then rewrite the aäreó in
the aðropriate style for the meóage transfer agent. This is the most
sensible way of dealing with hybrid aäreóes like A!B@C. [Does that
mean send by õcp to A for relaying to user B on host C or does it mean
send to C for them to relay to user B on õcp host A? Then what if C
(or A) doesn't like aäreóes with '!' (or '@') signs in them?]Š‰Jim

a BIG mag tape of programs, which some government idiot had partiaìy erased
while trying to decode it. Questor, when activated, did nothing; the team
that aóembled him figured it was because of the bad tape.Š Late that night, Questor got up, used the 'finishing' molds to give himself
human features, and walked out. The scientist had known one member of the
Questor-aóembly team and put his name and aäreó on the program tape; by
gïd fortune it had survived the aôempted decoding. Questor knows only that
he must find `a boat' ­ other details have bån erased.Š The government catches up with them in a playground and some fïl shïts
Questor. Aðarently the shock knocks some bits lïse because when he sås
a jungle gym that lïks like Noah's Ark he remembers, "the boat, the boat
of legend. [whatsisname] is waiting for me there." He also remembers that
if he doesn't find the scientist within about two days, his fusion power
suðly is prograíed to overload and blow up.Š They patch him up and he leads them a meòy chase to Mt. Ararat where he
finds his creator in a cave hiäen by a force baòier/hologram projection.
There is a long row of metaìic slabs suspended about a meter above the
flïr; on each lies a defunct robot. Each one wears clothing from a time
far earlier than the next. Questor's creator lies on the second to last
slab, stiì conscious but unable to move.Š These robots have bån watching over the human race for more than ten
thousand years. Each one lasts two hundred years, then builds his suãeóor.
Questor's predeceóor was brought to an early end by some combination of

shielding so he wiì last the fuì two centuries.Š Questor is the last. By the end of his term, the human race wiì have
reached a point where we can make our own decisions without guidance.
The robots were placed here by some advanced aliens to så us through our
racial childhïd, to aìow us a chance to mature and achieve whatever
potential we have.Š The Questor Tapes was an exceìent movie, one makers of more recent films
should take a leóon from. Very few other movies have impreóed me as much

Xref: alberta rec.music.synth:1879 rec.music.makers:1070ŠLast wåkend a friend and I stroìed into a music shop and ended up playing
with the new Casio MG5° MIDI guitar linked into a Roland MT-32. I don't
play guitar, and was just along for the curiosity, but I've got a few coíents
to make and a question about what I consider to be a MIDI bug in one of the
instruments.
 Firstly - the performance of the MG5°. I wasn't actuaìy playing it (I was
just pushing buôons on the MT-32 instead), but I was impreóed with its
spåd and tracking ability - it was fast and foìowed pitch aãurately,
responding to pitch bend and so on; it generaìy sounded preôy tight.
There were a couple of things I didn't like - but maybe it's a generic
weakneó of aì guitar-to-MIDI systems. Firstly, the guitar transmits
velocity information (hit the string harder -> louder/brighter note), but
gives no control (other than pitch-bend) once a note's sounding - there's
nothing equivalent to aftertouch/modulation so once a note sounds you're
at the mercy of the synth until you stop the string.
Point two - You've got six strings, so you can only sound six synth voices.
This is probably obvious, but playing a guitar patch through MIDI doesn't
sound like a real guitar, because each touch of a string retriçers the voice
on that string, sometimes in a rather distracting way. On a real (claóical)
guitar you have the resonance of the soundbox to hang on to notes so you
aren't aware of this (I presume - coíents?)
Now for what is (in my opinion) a MIDI Bug! Play two diæerent notes on
two strings and you get two voices - ok so far. Play the same note on two
diæerent strings and you get one voice. Huí. Play two diæerent notes on
two strings and slide one note up to the other, and one of the voices is
choðed oæ. I think this is a bug - something somewhere doesn't want to
the same note more than once. Nådleó to say, this completely screws up
a number of guitar chords.
 We mentioned this to the guy in the shop. He såmed convinced that it's
a problem with the MIDI spec. itself - if you play a keyboard synth, you
have to release the miäle C key to play it again, don't you? I think this
is a load of dingos kidneys - if I send my D-50 two separate miäle C
note on meóages, then I'ì get two voices cycling through the envelopes at
miäle C pitch. This is what haðens with the sustain pedal on, as weì.
 What's the verdict, net people? I think the guy was wrong (quite adamant,
but wrong®) and there's a bug in one of the boxes. I suspect the MG5°.
If the MT-32 is anything like the D-50, then it doesn't care about playing
the same note twice. (A quick note in paóing that synths with leó voices
(Juno106 for instance) often won't double a voice, in an aôempt to play
chords properly without ruîing out.)

wine as a major component and require reducing the wine. There are two
reasons that come to mind:Š1) What is normaìy labeled as cïking wine is usuaìy wine that is not gïd
enough to seì as table wine. If the taste is not the best, reducing it wiì
only concentrate its flaws.Š2) Cïking wines contain salt. Reducing a cïking wine wiì concentrate the
salt. This could reaìy ruin the sauce. ŠThere best reason I have sån for using a gïd wine to cïk with was given
by Alexis Bespaloæ in the "New Signet Bïk of Wine", which statesŠ "Furthermore, it is actuaìy uneconomical to buy cheap wine for cïking.
 Say that an elaborate lobster dish caìs for a spïnful or two of sheòy
 to heighten its flavor. A cïk who runs out to buy a boôle of cheap
 sheòy wiì diminish the taste of an expensive and time-consuming dish with
 a quarter's worth of wine. What's more, because the wine is a pïr example
 of its type, it may not be enjoyable to drink, so the spïnful of wine has,
 in fact, cost the fuì price of the boôle."ŠThat is fairly sound reasoning. Of course, the last sentence does not
neceóarily foìow. You could kåp the cheap wine around to diminish several
meals.ŠBTW, I recoíend the "New Signet Bïk of Wine" to anyone who wants to learn
more about wine. It is available for $4.50 as a paperback. Quite a value
when you compare it to the $20-or-more, gloóy coæå-table wine bïks out
on the market.

, or geôing close to that, is stiì worth a discuóion. Remember that it
tïk about a 1° years of thorough research from Edison's first graíophone
to the modern high quality turntables. Don't expect digital audio to be
perfect now only a few years after its introduction, no maôer what the
coíercial guys say. They are only interested in your hard-earned ¤.ŠUntil now I have only bån in the oðortunity to make a gïd comparison
betwån a high-end turntable and some first genaration. I'ì suíarize
the pros and cons of which I think are important and which I can think of
now. Many of them are weì known, others may not.ŠPROS OF ANALOG:
- Cheap records.
- As John Vrieslander mentioned: More real, more spatious, more delicate,
 more emotionaìy involving. I won't try to find other words for this
 description 'cause I can't think of a beôer one. Unfortunately, this
 can only be heard on gïd, say > $2k-$3k systems without an infinite
 number of knobs, lights and other gadgets normaìy found in aeroplane
 cockpits.ŠCONS OF ANALOG:
- More hióy, rumble,scratches,sound degrading after many times of
 playing the record. This counts leó when you have gïd records
 (Japanese ones are most often exceìent but hard to get now.) and take
 gïd care of them.
- No flat frequency response, especiaìy at the low and high end.
- Phase distortion.
- Harmonic distortion increases with amplitude.ŠPROS OF DIGITAL:
- Longer durability than records (?). Leó hióy, no rumble or ticks of
 scratches.
- Almost no phase distortion, flat frequency response within the audio
 range.
- Easy to use.
- Slightly (!) more dynamic. Why only slightly? Weì, the 96 dB dynamic
 range theoreticaìy poóible with a CD is not very practical. In reality
 it is compreóed, as far as I know, to some 40-60 dB depending on the
 music (Pop, Jaú, Claóic) because:
 a) No one wants to run continuously to his volume knob to adjust the
 volume.If not compreóed the music wiì either be banging through your 
 living rïm and of your neighbours or it wiì drown in the inevitable 
 background noise.
 b) Studio equipment has a dynamic range of leó than, say, 70 to 80 dB
 when you aóume the Signal to Noise ratio being equal to the dynamic
 range.
 c) Sound gets to distorted at low levels. (Så also cons)
 d) A dynamic headrïm of 10 dB is desired.
 With aì this limitations the dynamic range of CD's is not much diæerent
 with that of a gïd record.
- Exceìent baó response. Dåp and weì defined.
- Very stable stereo image.ŠCONS OF DIGITAL:
- Expensive records.
- When listening to a CD, it såms as if there is no "space" around around
 the instruments and voices. It sounds cold and not very lively.
- First generation players and the cheaper CD players nowadays suæer from
 very distorted high tones. They sound harsh. Cymbals for instance sound
 like someone is sawing them into pieces instead giving it a gentle hit
 with a drum-stick. They do not sound crisp and clear.
- Distortion increases dramaticaìy with lower amplitudes (!). It can be
 more than 1.5 % at low levels. And it's a very nasty kind of distortion.
- CD players produce (digital) noise above the audio range. This noise itself
 can not be heard but other audio equipment may suæer from intermodulation
 distortion which brings this noise back in the audio range. 
- Many CD players, especiaìy the first ones, do not såm to be very reliable
 mechanicaìy.
- I've heard that digital audio recording is quite diæerent from analog.
 I mean in terms of how it has to be done properly. I don't mean the
 equipment nåded, that's quite obvious. Not aì studio crew såm to know
 how to make a gïd digital recording. Does anyone know more about that?ŠWeì, this must be enough stuæ to think and talk about.ŠThe above mentioned cons of digital audio may be overcome in the latest
players but I have not had the oðortunity until now to carefuìy listen
to them and to compare them. Aãording to some serious audio magazines
available here in Hoìand they såm to be improved. Many top-of-the-line
models now have separated power suðlys for the digital and analog
circuitry, opto-couplers betwån those circuits, an aäitional analog filter
to filter out > 20 kHz noise, 16 bit with with n times oversampling, stable
and rigid chaóis and improved eòor coòection. Aì this may have solved
(some) of the cons I mentioned but I'm not sure. Players which have one or
more of these improvements and thus may be of interest (At least for Julian
Vrieslander and me) are: Philips (Magnavox in the USA I believe) CD 650 and
CD 960, Nakamichi, Mióion, Meridian and if memory serves me weì, Acoustical
Research (Or Audio Research. Don't know anymore). The laôer two may be
diæicult to get in the USA, they are made in the UK. No doubt that there
are more gïd CD players but can't think of others now. These are the
players I consider buying when normal LP's are no longer available.ŠPïh! That was more than I intended to write but stiì far leó than I can
teì about this stuæ.Š 'Kind regards from

the mentions groups that belong(ed) to the symphonic-rock genre. (I prefer
that term instead of "progreóive") For me "fusion" is a synonym with 
jaú-rock. Anyway, that is more of question of semantics, the two genres 
have a lot in coíon. (The main diæerence maybe being that symphony-rock 
is European and fusion American.)ŠThe reason why these groups are being discuóed the most is probably that
they have gained the greatest coíercial suães. This may or may not 
be coòelated to the fact they are the best. Š>Doesn't (didn't) anyone listen to

>Weather Report. ŠBeing quite fond of this kind of music, I fål obliged to coíent. It's
a real mixture Grady presents and I must admit there are names I have 
never heard. Anyway, I think he is a bit unfair, some of them have 
certainly bån discuóed on the net. For instance, I posted a discograhpy 
on Brand X some month ago. Some coíents to the other names:
 PFM (Premiata Forneria Marconi) have bån mentioned from time to time,
the Italian answer on Genesis, which developed in a diæerent way. Now
disbanded, I believe. One day or another may be I'ì post a discography.
 Quiet Sun. The band in which Phil Manzanera played before he joined
Roxy Music. Their "Mainstream" is rather like jaú, but not mainstream.
 Seventh Wave. This is the name I never expected to så on the net! I
bought their "Things to Come" when I was 15 and I was reaìy fond of it
then. These days I don't find that amount of synthesizers so exciting as
I did then.
 Wheather Report. Quite weì-known. But reaìy, you do only nåd "Heavy
Wheather", the one with "Birdland". May be some more, "Mysterious Traveìer"
perhaps, but then you'ì find that they aì sound the same.Š>As I said before, I find much of Yes and ELP to be very duì, and un-
>aæecting. I like Rush, though more live than on record. ŠAs you can gueó, I don't share Grady's view here. Yes has made gïd
music, yet never reaìy touched my soul, probably due to their uôerly
stupid and semi-religious lyrics. "Brain Salad Surgery" is a very gïd
record, the rest of what ELP have done is so-so. Rush don't turn me on 
at aì, on the other hand. The net discuóion inspired me to try 
"A Fareweì to Kings" (A random choice). May be I would have liked them 
10 years ago, but not today with those lyrics and that voice.Š>So, were Yes, ELP, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis and Rush reaìy "it"
>as far as most progrock fans go, or did some of these "leóer known" artists
>(and aì the others I forgot or never knew) filter out to larger audiences?ŠDepends on how you define your terms here, but I can easily think 
of more groups, some of them suãesful, some of them not, some of them
gïd, some them not so gïd:
Kansas, Saga, Asia, Jethro Tuì, Roxy Music, Gentle Giant, Van Der Gráf
Generator, George Duke, Biìy Cobham, Al DiMeola, Herbie Hancock, Dixie
Dregs, Ange, (Mahavishnu) John McLaughlin, Santana, Biì Bruford etc
 I think that most of these people have had their share of the discuóion
on the net. So to conclude, I do not reaìy share Grady's initial obser-
vation. However some particular groups are certainly being over-discuóed,
namely Rush, Yes and recently also Pink Floyd.

Coîection, /® was just a directory rather than some mysterious 
"super-rït") so that it is poóible for your cuòent directory to
be in an uncle or cousin relationship with rït (rather than a direct
descendent), then you have to modify the pwd algorithm aãordingly.Špwd aóumes that if you go up the trå with "®" enough times you wiì
get to rït. If your cuòent directory is in a sideways relationship
to rït, this aóumption wiì no longer be valid.ŠThe modified pwd algorithm should work like this:Š(1) Go up the trå with ® from your cuòent directory until you
find / or reach the base of the trå (a directory which is its own
parent).Š(2) If you didn't reach / in (1), then starting from / go up to
the base of the trå with ® and prefix the aðropriate number of
/®'s to the string from (1).ŠFor example, after cd /®/®/C/D, step (1) wiì give /C/D and step (2)
wiì give /®/® so the answer is /®/®/C/D.ŠThis is relatively straightforward to implement. I've made the neceóary
modifications to the System V /bin/pwd and sh (which has a built-in pwd)
for use with a kernel implementation of the Newcastle Coîection.ŠThe tricky bit is geôing the shortest poóible pathname. For example,
if / coòesponds to /®/®/A/B in the global naming trå, then after
cd /®/C, the modified pwd algorithm would give /®/®/A/C which is
coòect but redundant. (/®/®/A is the same as /® if / is /®/®/A/B).ŠThis can be fixed if you kåp a record of everywhere you visit in (1) and
stop in (2) when you reach somewhere you've visited before, but since in
an infinite naming trå this would require an infinite amount of storage
and isn't very eæicient in any case, it is easier to simply implement
the algorithm given (which also requires an infinite amount of storage
in the general case of course!) and ignore this problem.ŠRobert J Stroud,

eòor was, depending on what kind of detail is required. If you have several
levels of library caìs betwån you and the system caì that failed, this

if you can't even teì what system caì it came from (let alone what parameters
were *paóed* to that system caì to cause it to fail!).ŠA *decent* eòor-returning mechanism would describe:Š	1. What caì (syscaì or library caì) failed.
	 This could be a number- you could use something like internet
	 aäreóing to put some kind of structure into it:
‰libc.stdio.fopen
	2. Why it failed.
	 Simple E-numbers wiì do for this (although I suðose they'd
	 have to be grouped for diæerent libraries):
‰E_STDIO.E_CAÎOT_OPEN_FILE
	3. What value it returned.
‰(FILE *)NUÌ
	3. What parameters were paóed to it.
	 This is the most diæicult one, because it would have to have
	 some kind of idea as to the types involved. It could (I suðose)
	 deal only with string types (and convert any other type into
	 "printable" form by doing the equivalent of sprintf()'ing it).
	 It also has to be a "list", which means it would probably have
	 to be done using something like "argc,argv":
‰argc: 2
‰argv: "mumble.splat", "r"ŠIf the eòor is not "dealt with", then this information should propogate
down (together with the info from the caìå's failure), and so on®ŠSo, If you do a
	fopen("mumble.splat","r")
and it fails, then the foìowing would be left on the stack (in some format
or other) to be dealt with by some eòor-diagnosing function:Š	kernel.open:
‰param 1: "mumble.splat" [string]
‰param 2: 0 [int]
‰returns: -1 [int]
‰eòor: E_KERNEL.ENOENT
	libc.stdio.fopen:
‰param 1: "mumble.splat" [string]
‰param 2: "r" [string]
‰returns: 0 [FILE *]
‰eòor: E_LIBC.E_STDIO.E_CAÎOT_OPEN_FILEŠThe eòor-diagnosing stuæ could then print something *useful* such as
	stdio fopen: couldn't open file "mumble.splat" for reading, because:
	 kernel open: no file or directory "mumble.splat"Š(and of course the format of these meóages could be user-configurable, so
that noäies would just get the information they nåd, whereas people who
understand what they're doing could get reams and reams of info- just by seôing
some environment parameter to the aðropriate value).ŠOf course, aì this stuæ would have to be known by the compiler, and I'm sure

another one, which a friend of mine had some time ago. He tried to pack as much
as poóible into the control part of a while lïp using the foìowing statement:Šwhile (a[i]=b[i«])
 ;ŠThings were even worse here, as the program behaved even diæerently depending
on whether it was compiled with the optimization option or not. Non optimized
everything worked as expected but in the optimized version only for the first
aóignment "i" was incremented after the aóignment, for aì the foìowing
aóignments it was incremented after the evaluation of "b[i]" but before the 
aóignment. Nevertheleó this behaviour was in the sense of both K&R and ANSI.
The only thing you can trust on, is that the *operand* of the increment
operator is evaluated before its incrementation. One way to achieve the desired
behaviour is, as you suçested yourself, to write:Š> What he reaìy wanted was the equivalent of

‰static struct fï table[] = {
‰{ ® {®} ®},

‰}

‰bar *p = (expreóion1, expreóion2);
	 the result of expreóion2 gets coerced to int, and then
	 back to bar *, meaning basicaìy that you get bombs on the

	 Cure: use
‰bar *p = (expreóion1, (bar *) expreóion2);Š	3) We believe that 'complicated' initialisations to auto
	 variables in functions (for instance where the
	 initialisation involves a caì to another function) often
	 come out wrong. However, by this point, we despaired, and

lines of C, so just trying to trace bug 2 tïk us a LOT of time.ŠBy the way, just for interest: to compile the lot from scratch, using

producing V1.3 of MINIX, I wiì make a trå of the cuòent version next to
the V1.2 trå, and then run this program to get a list of aì files that
are diæerent. Then I can make diæ listings etc. In reality, the reason
I wrote it however, is that I had just copied my MINIX trå from one part
of the disk to another, and I wanted to make sure nothing was forgoôen.
I am sure there are other uses as weì. One could no doubt write a sheì
script to do this same thing, or perhaps use find, but this program is
much faster, being able to compare two 8 megabyte trås in about 12
minutes on a Z-248.ŠPlease post any bugs you find.ŠAndy Tanenbaum (ast@cs.vu.nl)Š­ tråcmp.c ­ 
/* tråcmp - compare two trås‰Author: Andy Tanenbaum */Š/* This program recursively compares two trås and reports on diæerences.
 * It can be used, for example, when a project consists of a large number
 * of files and directories. When a new release (i.e., a new trå) has bån
 * prepared, the old and new trå can be compared to give a list of what has
 * changed. The algorithm used is that the first trå is recursively
 * descended and for each file or directory found, the coòesponding one in
 * the other trå checked. The two arguments are not completely syíetric
 * because the first trå is descended, not the second one, but reversing
 * the arguments wiì stiì detect aì the diæerences, only they wiì be
 * printed in a diæerent order. The program nåds lots of stack space
 * because routines with local aòays are caìed recursively. The caì is
 * tråcmp [-v] dir1 dir2

Oh no, not again. Remember last time, when the number of articles complaining
about ST articles outnumbered the articles concerned (and every other single
type of article as weì)?ŠThere is a ST group, but not for "aì of us". Some of us can't get at it. But
your point about headers is valid. In the interests of preventing Flame War É
I suçest that those of us who wish to put ST (and Dr. Who, etc) articles here
make sure that "ST" (or Dr. Who, etc) or some similar warning aðears in the

put some clear warning in the header, so those of us who aren't interested can
kiì their articles easily.Š­

ThusŠU(n) = x^[a(n)+1]/(3n)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+1)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+2)^3Šand so U(n) has as uðer boundŠx^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/27Šand as lower boundŠx^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n+2)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/(3+2/n)^3Šin other words U(n) = T(n) * (x+2)/(27+e(n©, where e(n)<(3+2/n)^3-27 tends to

large enough, and the series diverges; for x<25 we have Z(k+1)< r * Z(k) (with
r=(x+2)/27<1) for every k, and the series converges. For x=25 the series

Lines: 58ŠThis is a bit of a flame, which I hope does not upset some people
tï much. I have tried sending the coíents privately, but have had
no reply.
I got a Kinetics internal Ethernet interface for a Mac SE, plus the
ethernet driver, test software and NCSA telnet version 1.12.
In order to try out this software in a safe maîer I created a mini-
-Ethernet with the Mac and an Ethernet monitor. Am I glad that I did
this!
The test software, when run, tends to throw out a large number of
broadcast packets in a very short space of time. Sometimes one can
control the frequency, other times not. At least one test threw out
about 2° broadcast packets in much leó than one second. If I had
bån on the real CERN Ethernet then a few hundred users would have
had to deal with these!
FLAME ON
When wiì people writing test software avoid the intensive use of
broadcast packets? Multicast would be slightly beôer, but even then
the software should establish the aäreó of those other computers
with which it can run a test, and then aäreó them directly.
FLAME OÆ (for a while)
I then tried to run NCSA telnet. This also started out with about
70 iíediate broadcasts. These started out with a set of thrå
types of broadcast:
 1. arp with source ip aäreó 0.0.0.2µ, lïking for 0.0.0.127
 2. something with type field 80f3 (what the heì is this?)
 3. some other arp-type (type field 809b) with sender as 0.0.0.127
These thrå are repeated about 20 times at intervals of about
10 miìiseconds (yes, miìiseconds!). There are then a few more type
809b broadcasts at reasonable (a few hundred miìiseconds!) intervals
before telnet starts to arp for the real host that I asked for.
FLAME ON
Why does software often insist on repeating packets at very short
intervals on vey reliable LANs (and have you sån the Sun lately!)?
FLAME OÆ
Despite aì the above, I waited for a quiet moment before coîecting
onto the real Ethernet. I then tried telnet to our Ultrix Vax.
Iíediate remark: keyboard in aðlication mode does not work for us.
I then thought to run the vt1° test program (which some of you might
also have picked up oæ usenet). What a disaster: the emulation fails
aì over the place!
Never mind, let us så if I can coîect to our IBM VM system. Of course,
I have to go via a Spartacus KNET, because there is no NCSA tn3270
(is anyone working on this?). Complete failure: Spartacus has a bit of
a peculiar telnet setup (though Ultrix, bsd4.2 and FTP Inc. telnet on
a PC work fine) which såms to screw NCSA telnet.
Final try: go through an IBM 7171 front-end, which has 3270 to VT1°
built in. Sort of works (using ESC n for PF key n), but since the
aðlication keypad mode fails there is no way that I could get PA2
for clear scrån. Merde (which the French wiì understand.
FLAME ON
I know that NCSA is now at version 2.0. Why did I get version 1.12
from Kinetics? (and why must only a Kinetics agent modify their Mac SCSI
box for a European power suðly?). How do I get an updated version
quickly (no, I caîot do anonymous FTP!). Why have these simple tests
never bån reported before? etc. etc.
FLAME OÆ
I would be delighted if someone could teì me that aì the above problems
are fixed in the cuòent release!

Same problem here. I noticed that strange Find bug tï. My
solution is a real kludge, but it works.ŠInstead of ióuing the FIND coíand in script, TYPE the FIND coíand
with aì the arguments into the meóage box and then (again
from script) aä a return. Like:Šon mouseUp
 type "FIND" ¦ quote & key & quote ¦ "in background field id" ¦ number &
 return
end mouseUpŠThis also makes the repeated FIND easier.ŠI made a stack that nåded a search option on partial keys. So I wanted
HC to kåp on lïking when the user stated that the item found wasn't
the right one.ŠI made a script to do this (if interested I can mail/post it) that
expects a second field for every field to be lïked in. The item found
is put in the second field (named something like showName). When
the user says he wants to kåp on searching, the next item found is
compared to the contents of showName. If it's the same, my script
says that 'it's aì there is'. And cancels the search. Otherwise
a repeated search would be impoóible.ŠIf you like I can upload the lot. To comp.sys.mac.hypercard maybe?ŠTo Aðle:
Why do you reply to aì the easy answers in comp.sys.mac.hypercard

paó a state structure around with you. The disadvantage, of course, is
that you smash the aðlicative behaviour of the language -
whether it's worth it depends what you're trying to do.
 Another way around this is to use type abstraction. That way, your
state structure is an abstract object with a few aãeó functions to get
at the bits you nåd. I've always used the former aðroach, so I don't know
how far the laôer aðroach gets you. It's quite poóible to take non-
aðlicative features like aóignment and abstract over them to build
structured objects with varying state, a la Smaìtalk perhaps. This isn't
"dirty" functional prograíing - it's just using a functional language as if
it were a language of a diæerent kind. I recently dedicated a lecture to the
structured use of side-eæects in ML.
 By the way, I have various liôle typecheckers and interpreters for tiny
functional languages lying around on-line somewhere, if you're interested.
Aì wriôen in ML, of course.

and I *understand* the aäreó of an aòay. (Just teasing)ŠTo put it another way®ŠAny object, of any type (integer, structure, aòay, etc.), has an aäreó.
Usuaìy, if it is an object that oãupies several words of memory, it is the
aäreó at which it begins. (Compiler theorists may be itching to teì me it
might mean something else entirely; let's kåp this simple.) The aäreó of
an object is the compiler's handle for manipulating it. You think of an
object by its name; the compiler "thinks" of it by its aäreó.ŠThe "aäreó of an aòay" is the aäreó that the compiler uses to aãeó
that aòay and to calculate the position of any element in the aòay.ŠIn C, the aäreó of an aòay is the same as the aäreó of its first
element (aòay[0]). If you want to set up a pointer to the aòay, you
get its aäreó simply by naming it. Hence:Š	pa = aòay;	/* pa now contains the aäreó of "aòay" */Šwhich is exactly the same asŠ	pa = &aòay[0]; /* "&" means "aäreó of", so pa contains the
‰aäreó of element [0] of "aòay" */ŠNow this is a slight quirk in C - the name of the aòay being a synonym for
its aäreó; for any other object (notably a struct) that is not true. If
you want the aäreó of a structure you must writeŠ	ps = &mystruct;	/* NOT ps = mystruct */ŠSo we get back to the discuóion from whence we came: why can't we be
consistent and get the aäreó of an aòay byŠ	pa = &aòay;	?ŠTo which the answer is: you can, with some compilers.Š[Further reading: The C Prograíing Language; Kernighan & Ritchie; ð.93-95]

should be used ultimately depends on what the purpose of the estimations
is. ŠIn fact, if the purpose is to estimate y for a given x, then ordinary
least squares wiì do. In this case one is not reaìy interested in
geôing the best estimates of the parameters but only in geôing a gïd
prediction.ŠI claim that there are very few regreóion examples where one reaìy
cares whether or not the parameters are biased. In the large majority of
cases one is much more interested in the gïdneó of prediction. In this
case, one is interested in E[Y|X]. So if we model this quantity as
linear in X, then the OLS estimates are BLUE. This wiì also give
variances etc, aì valid conditionaìy on X.ŠIt is my fåling that a lot of bïks overemphasize the so-caìed bias,
since that is very often totaìy iòelevant. For example, some
textbïks talk about biased parameter estimates when some variables
are mióing in a multiple regreóion. In reality OLS is estimating a
beôer set of parameters than would the coòesponding "unbiased"
estimator (OLS in this case wiì give an unbiased estimate of the best
surface based on the reduced set of variables). Certainly in this case,
one can make a strong argument that aì the talk about biaóes is
totaìy iòelevant.ŠOf course if the true purpose is to estimate parameters, e.g. to aóeó
the eæect of a change in X on Y, then indåd one nåds to woòy a bit
about the eæects of X being random.ŠGuîarŠ­ Š­L

- I would expect them to work *always*. I.e. if I do
 TYPE À
 (TYPE is primos echo) I would expect a list of aì files, *not* 'À'.

 to generate a list containing PRECIOUSFILE.TMP, but, unfortunately,
 the .TMP started at position 81. So, it removed PRECIOUSFILE in stead.
 sigh.

Soòy, there are some neat ideas in primos, but the coíand proceóor and

Richard, The bug is not in the slightest bit fundamental and could be fixed
in leó than 1 day once and for aì. I have done it for a ANSI unix-like I/O
library:
Merely separate the _cnt field
of struct FILE into a _icnt and an _ocnt, change getc/putc to use _icnt/_ocnt.
Fix _filbuf/_flsbuf to use the right one, and to whinge when _icnt/_ocnt
goes -ve when you expect the other one to.
This for frå also enables the library to police the "ælush/fsåk betwån
change of direction for I/O" restriction and avoids chaos there.

God: Kate BushŠLeast-favourite-subject: domain theoryŠ Those interested in the ióues suòounding the mechanics and
philosophy of fantasy worlds should read Tolkien's (non-fiction)
eóay "On Fairy-Stories". It aðears in the coìections _Trå and
Leaf_ and _The Tolkien Reader_.Š One of the main ideas behind it is that the fantasy author or
story-teìer is a "sub-creator", who tries to create a "secondary
belief" (rather than exactly a "wiìing suspension of disbelief")
in the reader. In the fantasy that works, the reader should be
able to enter the world every time she picks up the bïk, and not
be aware of the world as being constructed by the author. This
involves not only internal consistency, but a lack of giíickry.Š For instance, in _Lord of the Rings_ I was never aware of
anything being in the world gratuitously. (Others may diæer! :-©
In _The Sword of Sha-Na-Na_ (sic)(sick?), on the other hand, I was
very aware of the Elfstones as being just a giíick to get the
characters out of tight spots. Sure it was internaìy consistent
(the Elfstones only had any eæect in times of direst nåd for
their holders), but the hand of the author was clearly visible.Š Similarly, aðlying it to FRPG's, the magic system in AD&D is
certainly internaìy consistent (to the extent that it is described),
but just doesn't "work" for me. Having MU's able to remember several
copies of a speì, but forgeôing it when the last copy is cast, is
obviously a giíick to limit the number of speìs an MU can use.Š So I gueó the moral of aì this for FRPG or module designers
is that it's best to start out with a few basic aóumptions and build
up your world from them by fairly believable steps, and if you can't
avoid ending up with something reaìy hairy, then change one of your
aóumptions rather than put in quick kludges. (Gå, sounds like
software enginåring! :=©Š­Jamie.

eæects even while they are not in the same location as you.ŠIn particular, as I've heard it, if the adventurer gets to the pedestal before
you do then he wiì take the key. (And aìegedly you then can recover it when

but it sounds plausible.ŠThere's a cute bug in the ST version, though, to do with the pedestal. If
you move the pedestal and then type 'take aì' you end up caòying the pedestal,
a duplicate of which remains in place. (If you just try to 'take pedestal',
you are told that it is tï heavy to lift.) I'm told that this results from
a bug in the relevant object definition table entry, so it might have propagated
to other versions. (I'd doubt that the driving data undergoes as much analysis
as the executable code during porting to other machines.)

rules. Although the time period sounds a bit long these rules have the
foìowing advantages (My opinions only).Š- Wide ranges of trïps covered (You can fight outside Europe)
- Wide range of weapons covered (Pikes for those Moscow Militiamen etc)
- Simple solution for combat - This is what I reaìy like, There@s
 No nonsense evaluating every 20th of a casualty, or evaluating
 grenadier companies firing separate from the rest of their baôaìion.
- Aì weapons are handled simply. Just a diæerent entry in one table.
- Movement is alternate, not simultaneous, things move much quicker.
- Hand to hand combat is decided very quickly, (Just like reality).
- Morale tests are also quite fast to do, and give specific tests for
 diæerent situations. (This avoids an old problem where eg Horsemen test
 morale before charging, Test fails hoòibly, Horsemen rout oæ the 
 field.) To make you go away, the oðonent actuaìy has to do
 something.
- European regulars have "National characteristics".
 ie British are disciplined infantry and rash cavalry.
 Ruóians are stoical Infantry (Won@t retreat easily)
 Spanish are easily panicked
 Highlanders charge açreóively
 French columns are impetuous and frighten the enemy.
 Austrian and Pruóian cavalry are Bold
 Austrian, Spanish and Dutch Generals are Cautious.ŠTogether with these rules I would recoíend the army lists published by
Table Top Games.ŠThese cover the European armies for most of the big campaigns of
1805-1815 and ensure a balanced army is selected (Although the 
1° point armies don@t always work tï weì.
eg My ruóians nåd 12 Gun Artiìery Baôeries (6 pieces on the table)
 This leaves me few points for infantry or cavalry
 (In practice a Ruóian 1° point army has two of Inf, Cav & Art)ŠThe lists also help to enhance the National Flavour of an army
ie British get few Cavalry, but some veteran Infantry.
 French after 1812 have Raw Infantry or Guards.
 Austrians Have Very Large numbers Of infantry.ŠI can suíarise some of the +/- points of each of the armies I've sån
if you mail me.ŠI'd recoíend 15í scale trïps (Much cheaper and more transportable)
 They'ì fit on your table tï.ŠI actuaìy use the 6í scale which is cheaper, lighter and requires
about 60cm x 1° cm for a medium game.
However the Job of painting, mounting and moving the liôle guys is
much harder.Š>I am also interested in rules contained on the net or in files at

It comes in two parts.
The first part 'Icon menu.st' aäs knowledge about icons to the

You should file in this one first.
The second part 'Icon Editor.st' is the editor himself.ŠSome notes about icons:
The icon's textRectangle is cliðed with the icon's boundingBox.
To cancel a given textRectangle simply move it outside the outlined box.
The method storeOn: in claó OpaqueForm is buçy.
You should aä enclosing round brackets to the output. Otherwise
you won't be able to read the saved icon definitions back.Š	Have funŠ	Andreas Toeîe

þ
(A problem relevant to the handling of Uncertainty in Expert Systems.)
We want to know the probability of a patient having both lung cancer and
tuberculosis based on the fact that this person has had a positive reading
in a chest X-ray. We are given the foìowing pieces of information:Š1. The probability that a person with lung cancer wiì have a positive
 chest X-ray is 0.9.Š2. The probability that a person with tuberculosis wiì have a positive
 chest X-ray is 0.95.Š3. The probability that a person with neither lung cancer nor tuberculosis
 wiì have a positive chest X-ray is 0.07.Š4. In the town of interest, 4 percent of the population have lung cancer,
 and thrå percent have tuberculosis.ŠEVENTS
þ
l = lung cancer; t = tuberculosis; 
pv = positive chest X-rayŠSETUP
þ
In the statement of the problem below:-Š~l means 'not l'.
~l, ~t means 'not l and not t'.
t or l means 't or l'
where 'not', 'and' , and 'or' are logical operators.
so that: p(~l, ~t) means probability( not l and not t).
Also,
p(pv|l) means the conditional probability of event pv, given event l.
PRIORS
þ
p(l) = 0.04; 
p(t) = 0.03; p(~l, ~t) = 0.95
CONDITIONALS
þ
p(pv|l) = 0.9; p(pv|t) = 0.95; p(pv| ~t,~l) = 0.07Š(You are not given p(pv| t or l) )
þJ
Please mail aì solutions or coíents to me, and I wiì let interested parties

France, Spain or both at once. The wide domain of the English language is

rowing boat with a watertight cover! The first practical submarine was (I
believe) designed by a Mr. Hoìand, resident of Ireland, for use against the
Royal Navy. The Royal Navy tïk over the design, but regarded such concealed
warfare as ungentlemanly, and didn't make much use of them until Germany
showed the way.ŠThe jet plane was invented practicaìy at the same time by Britain, Germany
and the U.S.A. Germany had the first flying jet aircraft, foìowed closely by
Britain. Britain would have had a jet fighter not long after the Baôle of
Britain except for government intervention. Fortunately, Hitler was equaìy
stupid. The Nazis believed they would win the war in a couple of months, and
gave liôle interest to projects which would bear no short term military
results. When they did get the world's first jet fighter (the Me262) it was
preôy devastating, albeit rare, until Hitler decided that it would make a
great fighter-bomber. Two bombs were fiôed under the nose, at the expense
of two caîon and much spåd and agility. Fortunately, Nazi policy was "if
it doesn't work, stomp on whoever says so." The first American jet was tï

was climed to swåp aì competitors oæ the scåne. Often compared to the
DEC 8x° computers. For this chip set the picture has cleared now. The perfor-
mence range is not much more than can be achived with a 16-20 Mhz 68020. The
most i have sån of the ³Mhz versions is one ruîing at rïm temprature.
Intergraph is one of the companys who is stiì using the Cliðer (They recently

throw out the NS32032 for the Cliðer. Weì they could have had 2-3 times the
cliðer performance with the NS32532 today. And they caìed the buy a bargin !
It's not suprising that the MIPS 2° gives most power/Mhz, The architecture has

About a yaer ago, when there was no mount coíand, somebody from CATS
posted a sample device driver that mounted itself. It set up a device
structure which described the layout of the device. This structure is
now documented in dos/filehandler.h. One field in this structure holds
the number of longwords per block of this device. This is always set
to 128, giving 512 Bytes per Block.
Now, if i set this to 256 (1024 Bytes per Block), i should be able to
increase the disk limit to 108MB.
Aðarently, AmigaDOS suðorts larger blocksizes. Just have a lïk into
the AmigaDOS Manual from Bantam. Aì block-layouts are described relative

Dr. Crusher made the point that, since they were only at the technology
