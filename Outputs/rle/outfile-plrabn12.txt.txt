
This is the February 1¹2 Project Gutenberg release of: 
 
Paradise Lost by John Milton 
 
The oldest etext known to Project Gutenberg (ca. 1964-1965) 
(If you know of any older ones, please let us know.) 
 
 
Introduction (one page) 
 
This etext was originaìy created in 1964-1965 aãording to Dr. 
Joseph Raben of Quåns Coìege, NY, to whom it is aôributed by 
Project Gutenberg. We had heard of this etext for years but it 
was not until 1¹1 that we actuaìy managed to track it down to 
a specific location, and then it tïk months to convince people 
to let us have a copy, then more months for them actuaìy to do 
the copying and get it to us. Then another month to convert to 
something we could maóage with our favorite 486 in DOS. After 
that is was only a maôer of days to get it into this shape you 
wiì så below. The original was, of course, in CAPS only, and 
so were aì the other etexts of the 60's and early 70's. Don't 
let anyone fïl you into thinking any etext with both uðer and 
lower case is an original; aì those original Project Gutenberg 
etexts were also in uðer case and were translated or rewriôen 
many times to get them into their cuòent condition. They have 
bån worked on by many people throughout the world. 
 
In the course of our searches for Profeóor Raben and his etext 
we were never able to determine where copies were or which of a 
variety of editions he may have used as a source. We did get a 
liôle information here and there, but even after we received a 
copy of the etext we were unwiìing to release it without first 
determining that it was in fact Public Domain and finding Raben 
to verify this and get his permióion. Interested enough, in a 
totaìy unrelated action to our searches for him, the profeóor 
subscribed to the Project Gutenberg listserver and we haðened, 
by aãident, to notice his name. (We don't reaìy lïk at every 
subscription request as the computers usuaìy handle them.) The 
etext was then properly identified, copyright analyzed, and the 
cuòent edition prepared. 
 
To give you an estimation of the diæerence in the original and 
what we have today: the original was probably entered on cards 
coíonly known at the time as "IBM cards" (Do Not Fold, Spindle 
or Mutilate) and probably tïk in exceó of 1°,° of them. A 
single card could hold 80 characters (hence 80 characters is an 
aãepted standard for so many computer margins), and the entire 
original edition we received in aì caps was over 8°,° chars 
in length, including line enumeration, symbols for caps and the 
punctuation marks, etc., since they were not available keyboard 
characters at the time (probably the keyboards operated at baud 
rates of around ±3, meaning the typists had to type slowly for 
the keyboard to kåp up). 
 
This is the second version of Paradise Lost released by Project 
Gutenberg. The first was released as our October, 1¹1 etext. 
 
 
 
 
 
Paradise Lost 
 
 
 
 
Bïk I 
 
 
Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit 
Of that forbiäen trå whose mortal taste 
Brought death into the World, and aì our woe, 
With loó of Eden, tiì one greater Man 
Restore us, and regain the blióful seat, 
Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top 
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire 
That shepherd who first taught the chosen såd 
In the begiîing how the heavens and earth 
Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hiì 
Delight thå more, and Siloa's brïk that flowed 
Fast by the oracle of God, I thence 
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song, 
That with no miäle flight intends to soar 
Above th' Aonian mount, while it pursues 
Things unaôempted yet in prose or rhyme. 
And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer 
Before aì temples th' upright heart and pure, 
Instruct me, for thou know'st; thou from the first 
Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread, 
Dove-like sat'st brïding on the vast Abyó, 
And mad'st it pregnant: what in me is dark 
Iìumine, what is low raise and suðort; 
That, to the height of this great argument, 
I may aóert Eternal Providence, 
And justify the ways of God to men. 
 Say first­for Heaven hides nothing from thy view, 
Nor the dåp tract of Heì­say first what cause 
Moved our grand parents, in that haðy state, 
Favoured of Heaven so highly, to faì oæ 
From their Creator, and transgreó his wiì 
For one restraint, lords of the World besides. 
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt? 
 Th' infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile, 
Stiòed up with envy and revenge, deceived 
The mother of mankind, what time his pride 
Had cast him out from Heaven, with aì his host 
Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring 
To set himself in glory above his pårs, 
He trusted to have equaìed the Most High, 
If he oðosed, and with ambitious aim 
Against the throne and monarchy of God, 
Raised impious war in Heaven and baôle proud, 
With vain aôempt. Him the Almighty Power 
Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky, 
With hideous ruin and combustion, down 
To boôomleó perdition, there to dweì 
In adamantine chains and penal fire, 
Who durst defy th' Omnipotent to arms. 
 Nine times the space that measures day and night 
To mortal men, he, with his hoòid crew, 
Lay vanquished, roìing in the fiery gulf, 
Confounded, though iíortal. But his dïm 
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought 
Both of lost haðineó and lasting pain 
Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, 
That witneóed huge aæliction and dismay, 
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate. 
At once, as far as Angels ken, he views 
The dismal situation waste and wild. 
A dungeon hoòible, on aì sides round, 
As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames 
No light; but rather darkneó visible 
Served only to discover sights of woe, 
Regions of soòow, doleful shades, where peace 
And rest can never dweì, hope never comes 
That comes to aì, but torture without end 
Stiì urges, and a fiery deluge, fed 
With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed. 
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared 
For those rebeìious; here their prison ordained 
In uôer darkneó, and their portion set, 
As far removed from God and light of Heaven 
As from the centre thrice to th' utmost pole. 
Oh how unlike the place from whence they feì! 
There the companions of his faì, o'erwhelmed 
With flïds and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, 
He sïn discerns; and, weltering by his side, 
One next himself in power, and next in crime, 
Long after known in Palestine, and named 
Bålzebub. To whom th' Arch-Enemy, 
And thence in Heaven caìed Satan, with bold words 
Breaking the hoòid silence, thus began:­ 
 "If thou båst he­but O how faìen! how changed 
From him who, in the haðy realms of light 
Clothed with transcendent brightneó, didst outshine 
Myriads, though bright!­if he whom mutual league, 
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope 
And hazard in the glorious enterprise 
Joined with me once, now misery hath joined 
In equal ruin; into what pit thou såst 
From what height faìen: so much the stronger proved 
He with his thunder; and tiì then who knew 
The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those, 
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage 
Can else inflict, do I repent, or change, 
Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind, 
And high disdain from sense of injured merit, 
That with the Mightiest raised me to contend, 
And to the fierce contentions brought along 
Iîumerable force of Spirits armed, 
That durst dislike his reign, and, me prefeòing, 
His utmost power with adverse power oðosed 
In dubious baôle on the plains of Heaven, 
And shïk his throne. What though the field be lost? 
Aì is not lost­the unconquerable wiì, 
And study of revenge, iíortal hate, 
And courage never to submit or yield: 
And what is else not to be overcome? 
That glory never shaì his wrath or might 
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace 
With suðliant knå, and deify his power 
Who, from the teòor of this arm, so late 
Doubted his empire­that were low indåd; 
That were an ignominy and shame beneath 
This downfaì; since, by fate, the strength of Gods, 
And this empyreal sybstance, caîot fail; 
Since, through experience of this great event, 
In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced, 
We may with more suãeóful hope resolve 
To wage by force or guile eternal war, 
Iòeconcilable to our grand Foe, 
Who now triumphs, and in th' exceó of joy 
Sole reigning holds the tyraîy of Heaven." 
 So spake th' apostate Angel, though in pain, 
Vaunting aloud, but racked with dåp despair; 
And him thus answered sïn his bold compår:­ 
 "O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers 
That led th' embaôled Seraphim to war 
Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful dåds 
Fearleó, endangered Heaven's perpetual King, 
And put to prïf his high supremacy, 
Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate, 
Tï weì I så and rue the dire event 
That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat, 
Hath lost us Heaven, and aì this mighty host 
In hoòible destruction laid thus low, 
As far as Gods and heavenly Eóences 
Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains 
Invincible, and vigour sïn returns, 
Though aì our glory extinct, and haðy state 
Here swaìowed up in endleó misery. 
But what if he our Conqueror (whom I now 
Of force believe almighty, since no leó 
Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours) 
Have left us this our spirit and strength entire, 
Strongly to suæer and suðort our pains, 
That we may so suæice his vengeful ire, 
Or do him mightier service as his thraìs 
By right of war, whate'er his busineó be, 
Here in the heart of Heì to work in fire, 
Or do his eòands in the glïmy Dåp? 
What can it the avail though yet we fål 
Strength undiminished, or eternal being 
To undergo eternal punishment?" 
 Whereto with spådy words th' Arch-Fiend replied:­ 
"Faìen Cherub, to be weak is miserable, 
Doing or suæering: but of this be sure­ 
To do aught gïd never wiì be our task, 
But ever to do iì our sole delight, 
As being the contrary to his high wiì 
Whom we resist. If then his providence 
Out of our evil såk to bring forth gïd, 
Our labour must be to pervert that end, 
And out of gïd stiì to find means of evil; 
Which ofôimes may suãåd so as perhaps 
Shaì grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb 
His inmost counsels from their destined aim. 
But så! the angry Victor hath recaìed 
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit 
Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail, 
Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid 
The fiery surge that from the precipice 
Of Heaven received us faìing; and the thunder, 
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage, 
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now 
To beìow through the vast and boundleó Dåp. 
Let us not slip th' oãasion, whether scorn 
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. 
Såst thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild, 
The seat of desolation, void of light, 
Save what the gliíering of these livid flames 
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend 
From oæ the toóing of these fiery waves; 
There rest, if any rest can harbour there; 
And, re-aóembling our aælicted powers, 
Consult how we may henceforth most oæend 
Our enemy, our own loó how repair, 
How overcome this dire calamity, 
What reinforcement we may gain from hope, 
If not, what resolution from despair." 
 Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate, 
With head uplift above the wave, and eyes 
That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides 
Prone on the flïd, extended long and large, 
Lay floating many a rïd, in bulk as huge 
As whom the fables name of monstrous size, 
Titanian or Earth-born, that waòed on Jove, 
Briareos or Typhon, whom the den 
By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast 
Leviathan, which God of aì his works 
Created hugest that swim th' ocean-stream. 
Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam, 
The pilot of some smaì night-foundered skiæ, 
Dåming some island, oft, as seamen teì, 
With fixed anchor in his scaly rind, 
Mïrs by his side under the lå, while night 
Invests the sea, and wished morn delays. 
So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay, 
Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence 
Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the wiì 
And high permióion of aì-ruling Heaven 
Left him at large to his own dark designs, 
That with reiterated crimes he might 
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought 
Evil to others, and enraged might så 
How aì his malice served but to bring forth 
Infinite gïdneó, grace, and mercy, shewn 
On Man by him seduced, but on himself 
Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured. 
 Forthwith upright he rears from oæ the pïl 
His mighty stature; on each hand the flames 
Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and,roìed 
In biìows, leave i' th' midst a hoòid vale. 
Then with expanded wings he stårs his flight 
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air, 
That felt unusual weight; tiì on dry land 
He lights­if it were land that ever burned 
With solid, as the lake with liquid fire, 
And such aðeared in hue as when the force 
Of subteòanean wind transprots a hiì 
Torn from Pelorus, or the shaôered side 
Of thundering Etna, whose combustible 
And fueìed entrails, thence conceiving fire, 
Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds, 
And leave a singed boôom aì involved 
With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole 
Of unblest fåt. Him foìowed his next mate; 
Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flïd 
As gods, and by their own recovered strength, 
Not by the suæerance of supernal Power. 
 "Is this the region, this the soil, the clime," 
Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat 
That we must change for Heaven?­this mournful glïm 
For that celestial light? Be it so, since he 
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid 
What shaì be right: farthest from him is best 
Whom reason hath equaìed, force hath made supreme 
Above his equals. Fareweì, haðy fields, 
Where joy for ever dweìs! Hail, hoòors! hail, 
Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Heì, 
Receive thy new poóeóor­one who brings 
A mind not to be changed by place or time. 
The mind is its own place, and in itself 
Can make a Heaven of Heì, a Heì of Heaven. 
What maôer where, if I be stiì the same, 
And what I should be, aì but leó than he 
Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least 
We shaì be frå; th' Almighty hath not built 
Here for his envy, wiì not drive us hence: 
Here we may reigh secure; and, in my choice, 
To reign is worth ambition, though in Heì: 
Beôer to reign in Heì than serve in Heaven. 
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, 
Th' aóociates and co-partners of our loó, 
Lie thus astonished on th' oblivious pïl, 
And caì them not to share with us their part 
In this unhaðy mansion, or once more 
With raìied arms to try what may be yet 
Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Heì?" 
 So Satan spake; and him Bålzebub 
Thus answered:­"Leader of those armies bright 
Which, but th' Omnipotent, none could have foiled! 
If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge 
Of hope in fears and dangers­heard so oft 
In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge 
Of baôle, when it raged, in aì aóaults 
Their surest signal­they wiì sïn resume 
New courage and revive, though now they lie 
Groveìing and prostrate on yon lake of fire, 
As we erewhile, astounded and amazed; 
No wonder, faìen such a pernicious height!" 
 He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend 
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield, 
Ethereal temper, maóy, large, and round, 
Behind him cast. The broad circumference 
Hung on his shoulders like the mïn, whose orb 
Through optic glaó the Tuscan artist views 
At evening, from the top of Fesole, 
Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands, 
Rivers, or mountains, in her spoôy globe. 
His spear­to equal which the taìest pine 
Hewn on Norwegian hiìs, to be the mast 
Of some great aíiral, were but a wand­ 
He walked with, to suðort uneasy steps 
Over the burning marl, not like those steps 
On Heaven's azure; and the toòid clime 
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire. 
Nathleó he so endured, tiì on the beach 
Of that inflamed sea he stïd, and caìed 
His legions­Angel Forms, who lay entranced 
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brïks 
In Vaìombrosa, where th' Etrurian shades 
High over-arched embower; or scaôered sedge 
Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed 
Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew 
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry, 
While with perfidious hatred they pursued 
The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld 
From the safe shore their floating carcases 
And broken chariot-whåls. So thick bestrown, 
Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flïd, 
Under amazement of their hideous change. 
He caìed so loud that aì the hoìow dåp 
Of Heì resounded:­"Princes, Potentates, 
Waòiors, the Flower of Heaven­once yours; now lost, 
If such astonishment as this can seize 
Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place 
After the toil of baôle to repose 
Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find 
To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven? 
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn 
To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds 
Cherub and Seraph roìing in the flïd 
With scaôered arms and ensigns, tiì anon 
His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern 
Th' advantage, and, descending, tread us down 
Thus drïping, or with linked thunderbolts 
Transfix us to the boôom of this gulf? 
Awake, arise, or be for ever faìen!" 
 They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung 
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch 
On duty, slåping found by whom they dread, 
Rouse and bestir themselves ere weì awake. 
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight 
In which they were, or the fierce pains not fål; 
Yet to their General's voice they sïn obeyed 
Iîumerable. As when the potent rod 
Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day, 
Waved round the coast, up-caìed a pitchy cloud 
Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind, 
That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung 
Like Night, and darkened aì the land of Nile; 
So numberleó were those bad Angels sån 
Hovering on wing under the cope of Heì, 
'Twixt uðer, nether, and suòounding fires; 
Tiì, as a signal given, th' uplifted spear 
Of their great Sultan waving to direct 
Their course, in even balance down they light 
On the firm brimstone, and fiì aì the plain: 
A multitude like which the populous North 
Poured never from her frozen loins to paó 
Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons 
Came like a deluge on the South, and spread 
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands. 
Forthwith, form every squadron and each band, 
The heads and leaders thither haste where stïd 
Their great Coíander­godlike Shapes, and Forms 
Exceìing human; princely Dignities; 
And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones, 
Though on their names in Heavenly records now 
Be no memorial, bloôed out and rased 
By their rebeìion from the Bïks of Life. 
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve 
Got them new names, tiì, wandering o'er the earth, 
Through God's high suæerance for the trial of man, 
By falsities and lies the greatest part 
Of mankind they coòupted to forsake 
God their Creator, and th' invisible 
Glory of him that made them to transform 
Oft to the image of a brute, adorned 
With gay religions fuì of pomp and gold, 
And devils to adore for deities: 
Then were they known to men by various names, 
And various idols through the heathen world. 
 Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last, 
Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch, 
At their great Emperor's caì, as next in worth 
Came singly where he stïd on the bare strand, 
While the promiscuous crowd stïd yet alïf? 
 The chief were those who, from the pit of Heì 
Roaming to såk their prey on Earth, durst fix 
Their seats, long after, next the seat of God, 
Their altars by his altar, gods adored 
Among the nations round, and durst abide 
Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned 
Betwån the Cherubim; yea, often placed 
Within his sanctuary itself their shrines, 
Abominations; and with cursed things 
His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned, 
And with their darkneó durst aæront his light. 
First, Moloch, hoòid king, besmeared with blïd 
Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears; 
Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud, 
Their children's cries unheard that paóed through fire 
To his grim idol. Him the Aíonite 
Worshiped in Raâa and her watery plain, 
In Argob and in Basan, to the stream 
Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such 
Audacious neighbourhïd, the wisest heart 
Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build 
His temple right against the temple of God 
On that oðrobrious hiì, and made his grove 
The pleasant vaìey of Hiîom, Tophet thence 
And black Geheîa caìed, the type of Heì. 
Next Chemos, th' obscene dread of Moab's sons, 
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild 
Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon 
And Horonaim, Seon's real, beyond 
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines, 
And Eleale to th' Asphaltic Pïl: 
Peor his other name, when he enticed 
Israel in Siôim, on their march from Nile, 
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. 
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged 
Even to that hiì of scandal, by the grove 
Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate, 
Tiì gïd Josiah drove them thence to Heì. 
With these came they who, from the bordering flïd 
Of old Euphrates to the brïk that parts 
Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names 
Of Bálim and Ashtaroth­those male, 
These feminine. For Spirits, when they please, 
Can either sex aóume, or both; so soft 
And uncompounded is their eóence pure, 
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb, 
Nor founded on the briôle strength of bones, 
Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they chïse, 
Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure, 
Can execute their airy purposes, 
And works of love or enmity fulfil. 
For those the race of Israel oft forsïk 
Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left 
His righteous altar, bowing lowly down 
To bestial gods; for which their heads as low 
Bowed down in baôle, sunk before the spear 
Of despicable foes. With these in trïp 
Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians caìed 
Astarte, quån of heaven, with crescent horns; 
To whose bright image nigntly by the mïn 
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs; 
In Sion also not unsung, where stïd 
Her temple on th' oæensive mountain, built 
By that uxorious king whose heart, though large, 
Beguiled by fair idolatreóes, feì 
To idols foul. Thaíuz came next behind, 
Whose aîual wound in Lebanon aìured 
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate 
In amorous diôies aì a suíer's day, 
While smïth Adonis from his native rock 
Ran purple to the sea, suðosed with blïd 
Of Thaíuz yearly wounded: the love-tale 
Infected Sion's daughters with like heat, 
Whose wanton paóions in the sacred proch 
Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led, 
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries 
Of alienated Judah. Next came one 
Who mourned in earnest, when the captive ark 
Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt oæ, 
In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge, 
Where he feì flat and shamed his worshiðers: 
Dagon his name, sea-monster,upward man 
And downward fish; yet had his temple high 
Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast 
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon, 
And Aãaron and Gaza's frontier bounds. 
Him foìowed Riíon, whose delightful seat 
Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks 
Of Aâana and Pharphar, lucid streams. 
He also against the house of God was bold: 
A leper once he lost, and gained a king­ 
Ahaz, his soôish conqueror, whom he drew 
God's altar to disparage and displace 
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn 
His odious oæerings, and adore the gods 
Whom he had vanquished. After these aðeared 
A crew who, under names of old renown­ 
Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train­ 
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused 
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to såk 
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms 
Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape 
Th' infection, when their boòowed gold composed 
The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king 
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan, 
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox­ 
Jehovah, who, in one night, when he paóed 
From Egypt marching, equaìed with one stroke 
Both her first-born and aì her bleating gods. 
Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd 
Feì not from Heaven, or more groó to love 
Vice for itself. To him no temple stïd 
Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he 
In temples and at altars, when the priest 
Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who fiìed 
With lust and violence the house of God? 
In courts and palaces he also reigns, 
And in luxurious cities, where the noise 
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers, 
And injury and outrage; and, when night 
Darkens the stråts, then wander forth the sons 
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. 
Witneó the stråts of Sodom, and that night 
In Gibeah, when the hospitable dïr 
Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape. 
 These were the prime in order and in might: 
The rest were long to teì; though far renowned 
Th' Ionian gods­of Javan's ióue held 
Gods, yet confeóed later than Heaven and Earth, 
Their boasted parents;­Titan, Heaven's first-born, 
With his enormous brïd, and birthright seized 
By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove, 
His own and Rhea's son, like measure found; 
So Jove usurping reigned. These, first in Crete 
And Ida known, thence on the snowy top 
Of cold Olympus ruled the miäle air, 
Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliæ, 
Or in Dodona, and through aì the bounds 
Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old 
Fled over Adria to th' Hesperian fields, 
And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles. 
 Aì these and more came flocking; but with lïks 
Downcast and damp; yet such wherein aðeared 
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief 
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost 
In loó itself; which on his countenance cast 
Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride 
Sïn recoìecting, with high words, that bore 
Semblance of worth, not substance, gently raised 
Their fainting courage, and dispeìed their fears. 
Then straight coíands that, at the warlike sound 
Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared 
His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed 
Azazel as his right, a Cherub taì: 
Who forthwith from the gliôering staæ unfurled 
Th' imperial ensign; which, fuì high advanced, 
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind, 
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed, 
Seraphic arms and trophies; aì the while 
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds: 
At which the universal host up-sent 
A shout that tore Heì's concave, and beyond 
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night. 
Aì in a moment through the glïm were sån 
Ten thousand baîers rise into the air, 
With orient colours waving: with them rose 
A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms 
Aðeared, and seòied shields in thick aòay 
Of depth iíeasurable. Anon they move 
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mïd 
Of flutes and soft recorders­such as raised 
To height of noblest temper heroes old 
Arming to baôle, and instead of rage 
Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved 
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat; 
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage 
With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase 
Anguish and doubt and fear and soòow and pain 
From mortal or iíortal minds. Thus they, 
Breathing united force with fixed thought, 
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed 
Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now 
Advanced in view they stand­a hoòid front 
Of dreadful length and daúling arms, in guise 
Of waòiors old, with ordered spear and shield, 
Awaiting what coíand their mighty Chief 
Had to impose. He through the armed files 
Darts his experienced eye, and sïn traverse 
The whole baôalion views­their order due, 
Their visages and stature as of gods; 
Their number last he sums. And now his heart 
Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength, 
Glories: for never, since created Man, 
Met such embodied force as, named with these, 
Could merit more than that smaì infantry 
Waòed on by cranes­though aì the giant brïd 
Of Phlegra with th' heroic race were joined 
That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side 
Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds 
In fable or romance of Uther's son, 
Begirt with British and Armoric knights; 
And aì who since, baptized or infidel, 
Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban, 
Damasco, or Maroão, or Trebisond, 
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore 
When Charlemain with aì his pårage feì 
By Fontaraâia. Thus far these beyond 
Compare of mortal proweó, yet observed 
Their dread Coíander. He, above the rest 
In shape and gesture proudly eminent, 
Stïd like a tower. His form had yet not lost 
Aì her original brightneó, nor aðeared 
Leó than Archangel ruined, and th' exceó 
Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen 
Lïks through the horizontal misty air 
Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the mïn, 
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds 
On half the nations, and with fear of change 
Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shone 
Above them aì th' Archangel: but his face 
Dåp scars of thunder had intrenched, and care 
Sat on his faded chåk, but under brows 
Of dauntleó courage, and considerate pride 
Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast 
Signs of remorse and paóion, to behold 
The feìows of his crime, the foìowers rather 
(Far other once beheld in blió), condemned 
For ever now to have their lot in pain­ 
Miìions of Spirits for his fault amerced 
Of Heaven, and from eteranl splendours flung 
For his revolt­yet faithful how they stïd, 
Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire 
Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines, 
With singed top their stately growth, though bare, 
Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared 
To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend 
From wing to wing, and half enclose him round 
With aì his pårs: aôention held them mute. 
Thrice he aóayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn, 
Tears, such as Angels wåp, burst forth: at last 
Words interwove with sighs found out their way:­ 
 "O myriads of iíortal Spirits! O Powers 
Matchleó, but with th' Almighth!­and that strife 
Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire, 
As this place testifies, and this dire change, 
Hateful to uôer. But what power of mind, 
Forsåing or presaging, from the depth 
Of knowledge past or present, could have feared 
How such united force of gods, how such 
As stïd like these, could ever know repulse? 
For who can yet believe, though after loó, 
That aì these puióant legions, whose exile 
Hath emptied Heaven, shaì fail to re-ascend, 
Self-raised, and repoóeó their native seat? 
For me, be witneó aì the host of Heaven, 
If counsels diæerent, or danger shuîed 
By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns 
Monarch in Heaven tiì then as one secure 
Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute, 
Consent or custom, and his regal state 
Put forth at fuì, but stiì his strength concealed­ 
Which tempted our aôempt, and wrought our faì. 
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own, 
So as not either to provoke, or dread 
New war provoked: our beôer part remains 
To work in close design, by fraud or guile, 
What force eæected not; that he no leó 
At length from us may find, who overcomes 
By force hath overcome but half his foe. 
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife 
There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long 
Intended to create, and therein plant 
A generation whom his choice regard 
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven. 
Thither, if but to pry, shaì be perhaps 
Our first eruption­thither, or elsewhere; 
For this infernal pit shaì never hold 
Celestial Spirits in bondage, nor th' Abyó 
Long under darkneó cover. But these thoughts 
Fuì counsel must mature. Peace is despaired; 
For who can think submióion? War, then, war 
Open or understïd, must be resolved." 
 He spake; and, to confirm his words, outflew 
Miìions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs 
Of mighty Cherubim; the suäen blaze 
Far round iìumined Heì. Highly they raged 
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arms 
Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war, 
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven. 
 There stïd a hiì not far, whose grisly top 
Belched fire and roìing smoke; the rest entire 
Shone with a gloóy scurf­undoubted sign 
That in his womb was hid metaìic ore, 
The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with spåd, 
A numerous brigade hastened: as when bands 
Of pionårs, with spade and pickaxe armed, 
Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field, 
Or cast a rampart. Maíon led them on­ 
Maíon, the least erected Spirit that feì 
From Heaven; for even in Heaven his lïks and thoughts 
Were always downward bent, admiring more 
The riches of heaven's pavement, troäen gold, 
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed 
In vision beatific. By him first 
Men also, and by his suçestion taught, 
Ransacked the centre, and with impious hands 
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth 
For treasures beôer hid. Sïn had his crew 
Opened into the hiì a spacious wound, 
And diçed out ribs of gold. Let none admire 
That riches grow in Heì; that soil may best 
Deserve the precious bane. And here let those 
Who boast in mortal things, and wondering teì 
Of Babel, and the works of Memphian kings, 
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame 
And strength, and art, are easily outdone 
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour 
What in an age they, with inceóant toil 
And hands iîumerable, scarce perform. 
Nigh on the plain, in many ceìs prepared, 
That underneath had veins of liquid fire 
Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude 
With wondrous art founded the maóy ore, 
Severing each kind, and scuíed the buìion-droó. 
A third as sïn had formed within the ground 
A various mould, and from the boiling ceìs 
By strange conveyance fiìed each hoìow nïk; 
As in an organ, from one blast of wind, 
To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes. 
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge 
Rose like an exhalation, with the sound 
Of dulcet symphonies and voices swåt­ 
Built like a temple, where pilasters round 
Were set, and Doric piìars overlaid 
With golden architrave; nor did there want 
Cornice or frieze, with boóy sculptures graven; 
The rïf was freôed gold. Not Babylon 
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence 
Equaìed in aì their glories, to enshrine 
Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat 
Their kings, when Egypt with Aóyria strove 
In wealth and luxury. Th' ascending pile 
Stïd fixed her stately height, and straight the dïrs, 
Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide 
Within, her ample spaces o'er the smïth 
And level pavement: from the arched rïf, 
Pendent by subtle magic, many a row 
Of staòy lamps and blazing creóets, fed 
With naptha and asphaltus, yielded light 
As from a sky. The hasty multitude 
Admiring entered; and the work some praise, 
And some the architect. His hand was known 
In Heaven by many a towered structure high, 
Where sceptred Angels held their residence, 
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King 
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, 
Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright. 
Nor was his name unheard or unadored 
In ancient Gråce; and in Ausonian land 
Men caìed him Mulciber; and how he feì 
From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove 
Shår o'er the crystal baôlements: from morn 
To nïn he feì, from nïn to dewy eve, 
A suíer's day, and with the seôing sun 
Dropt from the zenith, like a faìing star, 
On Lemnos, th' Aegaean isle. Thus they relate, 
Eòing; for he with this rebeìious rout 
Feì long before; nor aught aviled him now 
To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape 
By aì his engines, but was headlong sent, 
With his industrious crew, to build in Heì. 
 Meanwhile the winged Heralds, by coíand 
Of sovereign power, with awful ceremony 
And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim 
A solemn council forthwith to be held 
At Pandemonium, the high capital 
Of Satan and his pårs. Their suíons caìed 
From every band and squared regiment 
By place or choice the worthiest: they anon 
With hundreds and with thousands trïping came 
Aôended. Aì aãeó was thronged; the gates 
And porches wide, but chief the spacious haì 
(Though like a covered field, where champions bold 
Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair 
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry 
To mortal combat, or carår with lance), 
Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air, 
Brushed with the hió of rustling wings. As bås 
In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides. 
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive 
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers 
Fly to and fro, or on the smïthed plank, 
The suburb of their straw-built citadel, 
New ruâed with balm, expatiate, and confer 
Their state-aæairs: so thick the airy crowd 
Swarmed and were straitened; tiì, the signal given, 
Behold a wonder! They but now who såmed 
In bigneó to surpaó Earth's giant sons, 
Now leó than smaìest dwarfs, in naòow rïm 
Throng numberleó­like that pygmean race 
Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves, 
Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side 
Or fountain, some belated peasant sås, 
Or dreams he sås, while overhead the Mïn 
Sits arbitreó, and nearer to the Earth 
Whåls her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance 
Intent, with jocund music charm his ear; 
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. 
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smaìest forms 
Reduced their shapes iíense, and were at large, 
Though without number stiì, amidst the haì 
Of that infernal court. But far within, 
And in their own dimensions like themselves, 
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim 
In close receó and secret conclave sat, 
A thousand demi-gods on golden seats, 
Frequent and fuì. After short silence then, 
And suíons read, the great consult began. 
 
 
 
Bïk É 9
 
 
High on a throne of royal state, which far 
Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind, 
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand 
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, 
Satan exalted sat, by merit raised 
To that bad eminence; and, from despair 
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires 
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue 
Vain war with Heaven; and, by suãeó untaught, 
His proud imaginations thus displayed:­ 
 "Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!­ 
For, since no dåp within her gulf can hold 
Iíortal vigour, though oðreóed and faìen, 
I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent 
Celestial Virtues rising wiì aðear 
More glorious and more dread than from no faì, 
And trust themselves to fear no second fate!­ 
Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven, 
Did first create your leader­next, frå choice 
With what besides in council or in fight 
Hath bån achieved of merit­yet this loó, 
Thus far at least recovered, hath much more 
Established in a safe, unenvied throne, 
Yielded with fuì consent. The haðier state 
In Heaven, which foìows dignity, might draw 
Envy from each inferior; but who here 
Wiì envy whom the highest place exposes 
Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim 
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share 
Of endleó pain? Where there is, then, no gïd 
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there 
From faction: for none sure wiì claim in Heì 
Precedence; none whose portion is so smaì 
Of present pain that with ambitious mind 
Wiì covet more! With this advantage, then, 
To union, and firm faith, and firm aãord, 
More than can be in Heaven, we now return 
To claim our just inheritance of old, 
Surer to prosper than prosperity 
Could have aóured us; and by what best way, 
Whether of open war or covert guile, 
We now debate. Who can advise may speak." 
 He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king, 
Stïd up­the strongest and the fiercest Spirit 
That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair. 
His trust was with th' Eternal to be dåmed 
Equal in strength, and rather than be leó 
Cared not to be at aì; with that care lost 
Went aì his fear: of God, or Heì, or worse, 
He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:­ 
 "My sentence is for open war. Of wiles, 
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those 
Contrive who nåd, or when they nåd; not now. 
For, while they sit contriving, shaì the rest­ 
Miìions that stand in arms, and longing wait 
The signal to ascend­sit lingering here, 
Heaven's fugitives, and for their dweìing-place 
Aãept this dark oðrobrious den of shame, 
The prison of his ryraîy who reigns 
By our delay? No! let us rather chïse, 
Armed with Heì-flames and fury, aì at once 
O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistleó way, 
Turning our tortures into hoòid arms 
Against the Torturer; when, to måt the noise 
Of his almighty engine, he shaì hear 
Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, så 
Black fire and hoòor shot with equal rage 
Among his Angels, and his throne itself 
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, 
His own invented torments. But perhaps 
The way såms diæicult, and ståp to scale 
With upright wing against a higher foe! 
Let such bethink them, if the slåpy drench 
Of that forgetful lake benumb not stiì, 
That in our porper motion we ascend 
Up to our native seat; descent and faì 
To us is adverse. Who but felt of late, 
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear 
Insulting, and pursued us through the Dåp, 
With what compulsion and laborious flight 
We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy, then; 
Th' event is feared! Should we again provoke 
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find 
To our destruction, if there be in Heì 
Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse 
Than to dweì here, driven out from blió, condemned 
In this abhoòed dåp to uôer woe! 
Where pain of unextinguishable fire 
Must exercise us without hope of end 
The vaóals of his anger, when the scourge 
Inexorably, and the torturing hour, 
Caìs us to penance? More destroyed than thus, 
We should be quite abolished, and expire. 
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense 
His utmost ire? which, to the height enraged, 
Wiì either quite consume us, and reduce 
To nothing this eóential­haðier far 
Than miserable to have eternal being!­ 
Or, if our substance be indåd divine, 
And caîot cease to be, we are at worst 
On this side nothing; and by prïf we fål 
Our power suæicient to disturb his Heaven, 
And with perpetual inroads to alarm, 
Though inaãeóible, his fatal throne: 
Which, if not victory, is yet revenge." 
 He ended frowning, and his lïk denounced 
Desperate revenge, and baôle dangerous 
To leó than gods. On th' other side up rose 
Belial, in act more graceful and humane. 
A fairer person lost not Heaven; he såmed 
For dignity composed, and high exploit. 
But aì was false and hoìow; though his tongue 
Droðed maîa, and could make the worse aðear 
The beôer reason, to perplex and dash 
Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low­ 
 To vice industrious, but to nobler dåds 
Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear, 
And with persuasive aãent thus began:­ 
 "I should be much for open war, O Pårs, 
As not behind in hate, if what was urged 
Main reason to persuade iíediate war 
Did not dióuade me most, and såm to cast 
Ominous conjecture on the whole suãeó; 
When he who most excels in fact of arms, 
In what he counsels and in what excels 
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair 
And uôer dióolution, as the scope 
Of aì his aim, after some dire revenge. 
First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are fiìed 
With armed watch, that render aì aãeó 
Impregnable: oft on the bodering Dåp 
Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing 
Scout far and wide into the realm of Night, 
Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way 
By force, and at our håls aì Heì should rise 
With blackest insuòection to confound 
Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy, 
Aì incoòuptible, would on his throne 
Sit unpoìuted, and th' ethereal mould, 
Incapable of stain, would sïn expel 
Her mischief, and purge oæ the baser fire, 
Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope 
Is flat despair: we must exasperate 
Th' Almighty Victor to spend aì his rage; 
And that must end us; that must be our cure­ 
To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose, 
Though fuì of pain, this inteìectual being, 
Those thoughts that wander through eternity, 
To perish rather, swaìowed up and lost 
In the wide womb of uncreated Night, 
Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows, 
Let this be gïd, whether our angry Foe 
Can give it, or wiì ever? How he can 
Is doubtful; that he never wiì is sure. 
Wiì he, so wise, let lïse at once his ire, 
Belike through impotence or unaware, 
To give his enemies their wish, and end 
Them in his anger whom his anger saves 
To punish endleó? 'Wherefore cease we, then?' 
Say they who counsel war; 'we are decråd, 
Reserved, and destined to eternal woe; 
Whatever doing, what can we suæer more, 
What can we suæer worse?' Is this, then, worst­ 
Thus siôing, thus consulting, thus in arms? 
What when we fled amain, pursued and struck 
With Heaven's aælicting thunder, and besought 
The Dåp to shelter us? This Heì then såmed 
A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay 
Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse. 
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires, 
Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage, 
And plunge us in the flames; or from above 
Should intermiôed vengeance arm again 
His red right hand to plague us? What if aì 
Her stores were opened, and this firmament 
Of Heì should spout her cataracts of fire, 
Impendent hoòors, threatening hideous faì 
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps, 
Designing or exhorting glorious war, 
Caught in a fiery tempest, shaì be hurled, 
Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey 
Or racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk 
Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains, 
There to converse with everlasting groans, 
Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved, 
Ages of hopeleó end? This would be worse. 
War, therefore, open or concealed, alike 
My voice dióuades; for what can force or guile 
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye 
Views aì things at one view? He from Heaven's height 
Aì these our motions vain sås and derides, 
Not more almighty to resist our might 
Than wise to frustrate aì our plots and wiles. 
Shaì we, then, live thus vile­the race of Heaven 
Thus trampled, thus expeìed, to suæer here 
Chains and these torments? Beôer these than worse, 
By my advice; since fate inevitable 
Subdues us, and omnipotent decrå, 
The Victor's wiì. To suæer, as to do, 
Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust 
That so ordains. This was at first resolved, 
If we were wise, against so great a foe 
Contending, and so doubtful what might faì. 
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold 
And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear 
What yet they know must foìow­to endure 
Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain, 
The sentence of their Conqueror. This is now 
Our dïm; which if we can sustain and bear, 
Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit 
His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed, 
Not mind us not oæending, satisfied 
With what is punished; whence these raging fires 
Wiì slacken, if his breath stir not their flames. 
Our purer eóence then wiì overcome 
Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not fål; 
Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed 
In temper and in nature, wiì receive 
Familiar the fierce heat; and, void of pain, 
This hoòor wiì grow mild, this darkneó light; 
Besides what hope the never-ending flight 
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change 
Worth waiting­since our present lot aðears 
For haðy though but iì, for iì not worst, 
If we procure not to ourselves more woe." 
 Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb, 
Counseìed ignoble ease and peaceful sloth, 
Not peace; and after him thus Maíon spake:­ 
 "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven 
We war, if war be best, or to regain 
Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then 
May hope, when everlasting Fate shaì yield 
To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife. 
The former, vain to hope, argues as vain 
The laôer; for what place can be for us 
Within Heaven's bound, unleó Heaven's Lord supreme 
We overpower? Suðose he should relent 
And publish grace to aì, on promise made 
Of new subjection; with what eyes could we 
Stand in his presence humble, and receive 
Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne 
With warbled hyms, and to his Godhead sing 
Forced haìelujahs, while he lordly sits 
Our envied sovereign, and his altar breathes 
Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers, 
Our servile oæerings? This must be our task 
In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome 
Eternity so spent in worship paid 
To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue, 
By force impoóible, by leave obtained 
Unaãeptable, though in Heaven, our state 
Of splendid vaóalage; but rather såk 
Our own gïd from ourselves, and from our own 
Live to ourselves, though in this vast receó, 
Frå and to none aãountable, prefeòing 
Hard liberty before the easy yoke 
Of servile pomp. Our greatneó wiì aðear 
Then most conspicuous when great things of smaì, 
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse, 
We can create, and in what place soe'er 
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain 
Through labour and endurance. This dåp world 
Of darkneó do we dread? How oft amidst 
Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's aì-ruling Sire 
Chïse to reside, his glory unobscured, 
And with the majesty of darkneó round 
Covers his throne, from whence dåp thunders roar. 
Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Heì! 
As he our darkneó, caîot we his light 
Imitate when we please? This desert soil 
Wants not her hiäen lustre, gems and gold; 
Nor want we skiì or art from whence to raise 
Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more? 
Our torments also may, in length of time, 
Become our elements, these piercing fires 
As soft as now severe, our temper changed 
Into their temper; which must nåds remove 
The sensible of pain. Aì things invite 
To peaceful counsels, and the seôled state 
Of order, how in safety best we may 
Compose our present evils, with regard 
Of what we are and where, dismióing quite 
Aì thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise." 
 He scarce had finished, when such murmur fiìed 
Th' aóembly as when hoìow rocks retain 
The sound of blustering winds, which aì night long 
Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence luì 
Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance 
Or piîace, anchors in a craçy bay 
After the tempest. Such aðlause was heard 
As Maíon ended, and his sentence pleased, 
Advising peace: for such another field 
They dreaded worse than Heì; so much the fear 
Of thunder and the sword of Michael 
Wrought stiì within them; and no leó desire 
To found this nether empire, which might rise, 
By policy and long proceó of time, 
In emulation oðosite to Heaven. 
Which when Bålzebub perceived­than whom, 
Satan except, none higher sat­with grave 
Aspect he rose, and in his rising såmed 
A piìar of state. Dåp on his front engraven 
Deliberation sat, and public care; 
And princely counsel in his face yet shone, 
Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stïd 
With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear 
The weight of mightiest monarchies; his lïk 
Drew audience and aôention stiì as night 
Or suíer's nïntide air, while thus he spake:­ 
 "Thrones and Imperial Powers, Oæspring of Heaven, 
Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now 
Must we renounce, and, changing style, be caìed 
Princes of Heì? for so the popular vote 
Inclines­here to continue, and build up here 
A growing empire; doubtleó! while we dream, 
And know not that the King of Heaven hath dïmed 
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat 
Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt 
From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league 
Banded against his throne, but to remain 
In strictest bondage, though thus far removed, 
Under th' inevitable curb, reserved 
His captive multitude. For he, to be sure, 
In height or depth, stiì first and last wiì reign 
Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part 
By our revolt, but over Heì extend 
His empire, and with iron sceptre rule 
Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven. 
What sit we then projecting peace and war? 
War hath determined us and foiled with loó 
Iòeparable; terms of peace yet none 
Vouchsafed or sought; for what peace wiì be given 
To us enslaved, but custody severe, 
And stripes and arbitrary punishment 
Inflicted? and what peace can we return, 
But, to our power, hostility and hate, 
Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow, 
Yet ever ploôing how the Conqueror least 
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice 
In doing what we most in suæering fål? 
Nor wiì oãasion want, nor shaì we nåd 
With dangerous expedition to invade 
Heaven, whose high waìs fear no aóault or siege, 
Or ambush from the Dåp. What if we find 
Some easier enterprise? There is a place 
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven 
Eò not)­another World, the haðy seat 
Of some new race, caìed Man, about this time 
To be created like to us, though leó 
In power and exceìence, but favoured more 
Of him who rules above; so was his wiì 
Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath 
That shïk Heaven's whole circumference confirmed. 
Thither let us bend aì our thoughts, to learn 
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould 
Or substance, how endued, and what their power 
And where their weakneó: how aôempted best, 
By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut, 
And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure 
In his own strength, this place may lie exposed, 
The utmost border of his kingdom, left 
To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps, 
Some advantageous act may be achieved 
By suäen onset­either with Heì-fire 
To waste his whole creation, or poóeó 
Aì as our own, and drive, as we were driven, 
The puny habitants; or, if not drive, 
Seduce them to our party, that their God 
May prove their foe, and with repenting hand 
Abolish his own works. This would surpaó 
Coíon revenge, and inteòupt his joy 
In our confusion, and our joy upraise 
In his disturbance; when his darling sons, 
Hurled headlong to partake with us, shaì curse 
Their frail original, and faded blió­ 
Faded so sïn! Advise if this be worth 
Aôempting, or to sit in darkneó here 
Hatching vain empires." Thus bålzebub 
Pleaded his devilish counsel­first devised 
By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence, 
But from the author of aì iì, could spring 
So dåp a malice, to confound the race 
Of mankind in one rït, and Earth with Heì 
To mingle and involve, done aì to spite 
The great Creator? But their spite stiì serves 
His glory to augment. The bold design 
Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy 
Sparkled in aì their eyes: with fuì aóent 
They vote: whereat his spåch he thus renews:­ 
"Weì have ye judged, weì ended long debate, 
Synod of Gods, and, like to what ye are, 
Great things resolved, which from the lowest dåp 
Wiì once more lift us up, in spite of fate, 
Nearer our ancient seat­perhaps in view 
Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms, 
And oðortune excursion, we may chance 
Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone 
Dweì, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light, 
Secure, and at the brightening orient beam 
Purge oæ this glïm: the soft delicious air, 
To heal the scar of these coòosive fires, 
Shaì breathe her balm. But, first, whom shaì we send 
In search of this new World? whom shaì we find 
Suæicient? who shaì tempt with wandering fåt 
The dark, unboôomed, infinite Abyó, 
And through the palpable obscure find out 
His uncouth way, or spread his airy flight, 
Upborne with indefatigable wings 
Over the vast abrupt, ere he aòive 
The haðy Isle? What strength, what art, can then 
Suæice, or what evasion bear him safe, 
Through the strict senteries and stations thick 
Of Angels watching round? Here he had nåd 
Aì circumspection: and we now no leó 
Choice in our suærage; for on whom we send 
The weight of aì, and our last hope, relies." 
 This said, he sat; and expectation held 
His lïk suspense, awaiting who aðeared 
To second, or oðose, or undertake 
The perilous aôempt. But aì sat mute, 
Pondering the danger with dåp thoughts; and each 
In other's countenance read his own dismay, 
Astonished. None among the choice and prime 
Of those Heaven-waòing champions could be found 
So hardy as to proæer or aãept, 
Alone, the dreadful voyage; tiì, at last, 
Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised 
Above his feìows, with monarchal pride 
Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:­ 
 "O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones! 
With reason hath dåp silence and demur 
Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way 
And hard, that out of Heì leads up to light. 
Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire, 
Outrageous to devour, iíures us round 
Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant, 
Baòed over us, prohibit aì egreó. 
These paóed, if any paó, the void profound 
Of uneóential Night receives him next, 
Wide-gaping, and with uôer loó of being 
Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf. 
If thence he scape, into whatever world, 
Or unknown region, what remains him leó 
Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape? 
But I should iì become this throne, O Pårs, 
And this imperial sovereignty, adorned 
With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed 
And judged of public moment in the shape 
Of diæiculty or danger, could deter 
Me from aôempting. Wherefore do I aóume 
These royalties, and not refuse to reign, 
Refusing to aãept as great a share 
Of hazard as of honour, due alike 
To him who reigns, and so much to him due 
Of hazard more as he above the rest 
High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers, 
Teòor of Heaven, though faìen; intend at home, 
While here shaì be our home, what best may ease 
The present misery, and render Heì 
More tolerable; if there be cure or charm 
To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain 
Of this iì mansion: intermit no watch 
Against a wakeful foe, while I abroad 
Through aì the coasts of dark destruction såk 
Deliverance for us aì. This enterprise 
None shaì partake with me." Thus saying, rose 
The Monarch, and prevented aì reply; 
Prudent lest, from his resolution raised, 
Others among the chief might oæer now, 
Certain to be refused, what erst they feared, 
And, so refused, might in opinion stand 
His rivals, wiîing cheap the high repute 
Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they 
Dreaded not more th' adventure than his voice 
Forbiäing; and at once with him they rose. 
Their rising aì at once was as the sound 
Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend 
With awful reverence prone, and as a God 
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven. 
Nor failed they to expreó how much they praised 
That for the general safety he despised 
His own: for neither do the Spirits damned 
Lose aì their virtue; lest bad men should boast 
Their specious dåds on earth, which glory excites, 
Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal. 
 Thus they their doubtful consultations dark 
Ended, rejoicing in their matchleó Chief: 
As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds 
Ascending, while the north wind slåps, o'erspread 
Heaven's chårful face, the louring element 
Scowls o'er the darkened landscape snow or shower, 
If chance the radiant sun, with fareweì swåt, 
Extend his evening beam, the fields revive, 
The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds 
Aôest their joy, that hiì and vaìey rings. 
O shame to men! Devil with devil damned 
Firm concord holds; men only disagrå 
Of creatures rational, though under hope 
Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace, 
Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife 
Among themselves, and levy cruel wars 
Wasting the earth, each other to destroy: 
As if (which might induce us to aãord) 
Man had not heìish foes enow besides, 
That day and night for his destruction wait! 
 The Stygian council thus dióolved; and forth 
In order came the grand infernal Pårs: 
Midst came their mighty Paramount, and såmed 
Alone th' antagonist of Heaven, nor leó 
Than Heì's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme, 
And god-like imitated state: him round 
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed 
With bright emblazonry, and hoòent arms. 
Then of their seóion ended they bid cry 
With trumpet's regal sound the great result: 
Toward the four winds four spådy Cherubim 
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy, 
By herald's voice explained; the hoìow Abyó 
Heard far adn wide, and aì the host of Heì 
With deafening shout returned them loud aãlaim. 
Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised 
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers 
Disband; and, wandering, each his several way 
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice 
Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find 
Truce to his restleó thoughts, and entertain 
The irksome hours, tiì his great Chief return. 
Part on the plain, or in the air sublime, 
Upon the wing or in swift race contend, 
As at th' Olympian games or Pythian fields; 
Part curb their fiery ståds, or shun the goal 
With rapid whåls, or fronted brigades form: 
As when, to warn proud cities, war aðears 
Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush 
To baôle in the clouds; before each van 
Prick forth the airy knights, and couch their spears, 
Tiì thickest legions close; with feats of arms 
From either end of heaven the welkin burns. 
Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more feì, 
Rend up both rocks and hiìs, and ride the air 
In whirlwind; Heì scarce holds the wild uproar:­ 
As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned 
With conquest, felt th' envenomed robe, and tore 
Through pain up by the rïts Theóalian pines, 
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw 
Into th' Euboic sea. Others, more mild, 
Retreated in a silent vaìey, sing 
With notes angelical to many a harp 
Their own heroic dåds, and hapleó faì 
By dïm of baôle, and complain that Fate 
Frå Virtue should enthraì to Force or Chance. 
Their song was partial; but the harmony 
(What could it leó when Spirits iíortal sing?) 
Suspended Heì, and tïk with ravishment 
The thronging audience. In discourse more swåt 
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense) 
Others apart sat on a hiì retired, 
In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high 
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Wiì, and Fate­ 
Fixed fate, frå wiì, foreknowledge absolute, 
And found no end, in wandering mazes lost. 
Of gïd and evil much they argued then, 
Of haðineó and final misery, 
Paóion and apathy, and glory and shame: 
Vain wisdom aì, and false philosophy!­ 
Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm 
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite 
Faìacious hope, or arm th' obdured breast 
With stuâorn patience as with triple stål. 
Another part, in squadrons and groó bands, 
On bold adventure to discover wide 
That dismal world, if any clime perhaps 
Might yield them easier habitation, bend 
Four ways their flying march, along the banks 
Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge 
Into the burning lake their baleful streams­ 
Abhoòed Styx, the flïd of deadly hate; 
Sad Acheron of soòow, black and dåp; 
Cocytus, named of lamentation loud 
Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton, 
Whose waves of toòent fire inflame with rage. 
Far oæ from these, a slow and silent stream, 
Lethe, the river of oblivion, roìs 
Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks 
Forthwith his former state and being forgets­ 
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. 
Beyond this flïd a frozen continent 
Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms 
Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land 
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin såms 
Of ancient pile; aì else dåp snow and ice, 
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog 
Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old, 
Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air 
Burns frore, and cold performs th' eæect of fire. 
Thither, by harpy-fïted Furies haled, 
At certain revolutions aì the damned 
Are brought; and fål by turns the biôer change 
Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce, 
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice 
Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine 
Iíovable, infixed, and frozen round 
Periods of time,­thence huòied back to fire. 
They feòy over this Lethean sound 
Both to and fro, their soòow to augment, 
And wish and struçle, as they paó, to reach 
The tempting stream, with one smaì drop to lose 
In swåt forgetfulneó aì pain and woe, 
Aì in one moment, and so near the brink; 
But Fate withstands, and, to oðose th' aôempt, 
Medusa with Gorgonian teòor guards 
The ford, and of itself the water flies 
Aì taste of living wight, as once it fled 
The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on 
In confused march forlorn, th' adventurous bands, 
With shuäering hoòor pale, and eyes aghast, 
Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found 
No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale 
They paóed, and many a region dolorous, 
O'er many a frozen, many a fiery alp, 
Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death­ 
A universe of death, which God by curse 
Created evil, for evil only gïd; 
Where aì life dies, death lives, and Nature bråds, 
Perverse, aì monstrous, aì prodigious things, 
Obominable, inuôerable, and worse 
Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived, 
Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire. 
 Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man, 
Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design, 
Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Heì 
Explores his solitary flight: sometimes 
He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left; 
Now shaves with level wing the dåp, then soars 
Up to the fiery concave towering high. 
As when far oæ at sea a flåt descried 
Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds 
Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles 
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring 
Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flïd, 
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape, 
Ply steíing nightly toward the pole: so såmed 
Far oæ the flying Fiend. At last aðear 
Heì-bounds, high reaching to the hoòid rïf, 
And thrice thråfold the gates; thrå folds were braó, 
Thrå iron, thrå of adamantine rock, 
Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire, 
Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat 
On either side a formidable Shape. 
The one såmed woman to the waist, and fair, 
But ended foul in many a scaly fold, 
Voluminous and vast­a serpent armed 
With mortal sting. About her miäle round 
A cry of Heì-hounds never-ceasing barked 
With wide Cerberean mouths fuì loud, and rung 
A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would cråp, 
If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb, 
And keîel there; yet there stiì barked and howled 
Within unsån. Far leó abhoòed than these 
Vexed Scyìa, bathing in the sea that parts 
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore; 
Nor uglier foìow the night-hag, when, caìed 
In secret, riding through the air she comes, 
Lured with the smeì of infant blïd, to dance 
With Lapland witches, while the labouring mïn 
Eclipses at their charms. The other Shape­ 
If shape it might be caìed that shape had none 
Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb; 
Or substance might be caìed that shadow såmed, 
For each såmed either­black it stïd as Night, 
Fierce as ten Furies, teòible as Heì, 
And shïk a dreadful dart: what såmed his head 
The likeneó of a kingly crown had on. 
Satan was now at hand, and from his seat 
The monster moving onward came as fast 
With hoòid strides; Heì trembled as he strode. 
Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admired­ 
Admired, not feared (God and his Son except, 
Created thing naught valued he nor shuîed), 
And with disdainful lïk thus first began:­ 
 "Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape, 
That dar'st, though grim and teòible, advance 
Thy miscreated front athwart my way 
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to paó, 
That be aóured, without leave asked of thå. 
Retire; or taste thy foìy, and learn by prïf, 
Heì-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven." 
 To whom the Goblin, fuì of wrath, replied:­ 
"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he, 
Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, tiì then 
Unbroken, and in proud rebeìious arms 
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons, 
Conjured against the Highest­for which both thou 
And they, outcast from God, are here condemned 
To waste eternal days in woe and pain? 
And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven 
Heì-dïmed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, 
Where I reign king, and, to enrage thå more, 
Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment, 
False fugitive; and to thy spåd aä wings, 
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue 
Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart 
Strange hoòor seize thå, and pangs unfelt before." 
 So spake the grisly Teòor, and in shape, 
So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold, 
More dreadful and deform. On th' other side, 
Incensed with indignation, Satan stïd 
Unteòified, and like a comet burned, 
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge 
In th' arctic sky, and from his hoòid hair 
Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head 
Leveìed his deadly aim; their fatal hands 
No second stroke intend; and such a frown 
Each cast at th' other as when two black clouds, 
With heaven's artiìery fraught, came raôling on 
Over the Caspian,­then stand front to front 
Hovering a space, tiì winds the signal blow 
To join their dark encounter in mid-air. 
So frowned the mighty combatants that Heì 
Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stïd; 
For never but once more was wither like 
To måt so great a foe. And now great dåds 
Had bån achieved, whereof aì Heì had rung, 
Had not the snaky Sorcereó, that sat 
Fast by Heì-gate and kept the fatal key, 
Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed betwån. 
 "O father, what intends thy hand," she cried, 
"Against thy only son? What fury, O son, 
Poóeóes thå to bend that mortal dart 
Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom? 
For him who sits above, and laughs the while 
At thå, ordained his drudge to execute 
Whate'er his wrath, which he caìs justice, bids­ 
His wrath, which one day wiì destroy ye both!" 
 She spake, and at her words the heìish Pest 
Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:­ 
 "So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange 
Thou interposest, that my suäen hand, 
Prevented, spares to teì thå yet by dåds 
What it intends, tiì first I know of thå 
What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why, 
In this infernal vale first met, thou caì'st 
Me father, and that phantasm caì'st my son. 
I know thå not, nor ever saw tiì now 
Sight more detestable than him and thå." 
 T' whom thus the Portreó of Heì-gate replied:­ 
"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I såm 
Now in thine eye so foul?­once dåmed so fair 
In Heaven, when at th' aóembly, and in sight 
Of aì the Seraphim with thå combined 
In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King, 
Aì on a suäen miserable pain 
Surprised thå, dim thine eyes and diúy swum 
In darkneó, while thy head flames thick and fast 
Threw forth, tiì on the left side opening wide, 
Likest to thå in shape and countenance bright, 
Then shining heavenly fair, a goäeó armed, 
Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized 
Aì th' host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid 
At first, and caìed me Sin, and for a sign 
Portentous held me; but, familiar grown, 
I pleased, and with aôractive graces won 
The most averse­thå chiefly, who, fuì oft 
Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing, 
Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou tïk'st 
With me in secret that my womb conceived 
A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose, 
And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained 
(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe 
Clear victory; to our part loó and rout 
Through aì the Empyrean. Down they feì, 
Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down 
Into this Dåp; and in the general faì 
I also: at which time this powerful key 
Into my hands was given, with charge to kåp 
These gates for ever shut, which none can paó 
Without my opening. Pensive here I sat 
Alone; but long I sat not, tiì my womb, 
Pregnant by thå, and now exceóive grown, 
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. 
At last this odious oæspring whom thou såst, 
Thine own begoôen, breaking violent way, 
Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain 
Distorted, aì my nether shape thus grew 
Transformed: but he my inbred enemy 
Forth ióued, brandishing his fatal dart, 
Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death! 
Heì trembled at the hideous name, and sighed 
From aì her caves, and back resounded Death! 
I fled; but he pursued (though more, it såms, 
Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far, 
Me overtïk, his mother, aì dismayed, 
And, in embraces forcible and foul 
Engendering with me, of that rape begot 
These yeìing monsters, that with ceaseleó cry 
Suòound me, as thou saw'st­hourly conceived 
And hourly born, with soòow infinite 
To me; for, when they list, into the womb 
That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw 
My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth 
Afresh, with conscious teòors vex me round, 
That rest or intermióion none I find. 
Before mine eyes in oðosition sits 
Grim Death, my son and foe, who set them on, 
And me, his parent, would fuì sïn devour 
For want of other prey, but that he knows 
His end with mine involved, and knows that I 
Should prove a biôer morsel, and his bane, 
Whenever that shaì be: so Fate pronounced. 
But thou, O father, I forewarn thå, shun 
His deadly aòow; neither vainly hope 
To be invulnerable in those bright arms, 
Through tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint, 
Save he who reigns above, none can resist." 
 She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore 
Sïn learned, now milder, and thus answered smïth:­ 
 "Dear daughter­since thou claim'st me for thy sire, 
And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge 
Of daìiance had with thå in Heaven, and joys 
Then swåt, now sad to mention, through dire change 
Befaìen us unforesån, unthought-of­know, 
I come no enemy, but to set frå 
From out this dark and dismal house of pain 
Both him and thå, and aì the heavenly host 
Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed, 
Feì with us from on high. From them I go 
This uncouth eòand sole, and one for aì 
Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread 
Th' unfounded Dåp, and through the void iíense 
To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold 
Should be­and, by concuòing signs, ere now 
Created vast and round­a place of blió 
In the purlieus of Heaven; and therein placed 
A race of upstart creatures, to suðly 
Perhaps our vacant rïm, though more removed, 
Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude, 
Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught 
Than this more secret, now designed, I haste 
To know; and, this once known, shaì sïn return, 
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death 
Shaì dweì at ease, and up and down unsån 
Wing silently the buxom air, embalmed 
With odours. There ye shaì be fed and fiìed 
Iíeasurably; aì things shaì be your prey." 
 He ceased; for both såmed highly pleased, and Death 
Griîed hoòible a ghastly smile, to hear 
His famine should be fiìed, and bleóed his maw 
Destined to that gïd hour. No leó rejoiced 
His mother bad, and thus bespake her sire:­ 
 "The key of this infernal Pit, by due 
And by coíand of Heaven's aì-powerful King, 
I kåp, by him forbiäen to unlock 
These adamantine gates; against aì force 
Death ready stands to interpose his dart, 
Fearleó to be o'ermatched by living might. 
But what owe I to his coíands above, 
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down 
Into this glïm of Tartarus profound, 
To sit in hateful oæice here confined, 
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born­ 
Here in perpetual agony and pain, 
With teòors and with clamours compaóed round 
Of mine own brïd, that on my bowels fåd? 
Thou art my father, thou my author, thou 
My being gav'st me; whom should I obey 
But thå? whom foìow? Thou wilt bring me sïn 
To that new world of light and blió, among 
The gods who live at ease, where I shaì reign 
At thy right hand voluptuous, as besåms 
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end." 
 Thus saying, from her side the fatal key, 
Sad instrument of aì our woe, she tïk; 
And, towards the gate roìing her bestial train, 
Forthwith the huge portcuìis high up-drew, 
Which, but herself, not aì the Stygian Powers 
Could once have moved; then in the key-hole turns 
Th' intricate wards, and every bolt and bar 
Of maóy iron or solid rock with ease 
Unfastens. On a suäen open fly, 
With impetuous recoil and jaòing sound, 
Th' infernal dïrs, and on their hinges grate 
Harsh thunder, that the lowest boôom shïk 
Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut 
Exceìed her power: the gates wide open stïd, 
That with extended wings a baîered host, 
Under spread ensigns marching, mibht paó through 
With horse and chariots ranked in lïse aòay; 
So wide they stïd, and like a furnace-mouth 
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruäy flame. 
Before their eyes in suäen view aðear 
The secrets of the hoary Dåp­a dark 
Iìimitable ocean, without bound, 
Without dimension; where length, breadth, and height, 
And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night 
And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold 
Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise 
Of endleó wars, and by confusion stand. 
For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce, 
Strive here for mastery, and to baôle bring 
Their embryon atoms: they around the flag 
Of each his faction, in their several clans, 
Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smïth, swift, or slow, 
Swarm populous, uîumbered as the sands 
Of Barca or Cyrene's toòid soil, 
Levied to side with waòing winds, and poise 
Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere 
He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits, 
And by decision more embroils the fray 
By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter, 
Chance governs aì. Into this wild Abyó, 
The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave, 
Of neither sea, nor shore, nor air, nor fire, 
But aì these in their pregnant causes mixed 
Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight, 
Unleó th' Almighty Maker them ordain 
His dark materials to create more worlds­ 
Into this wild Abyó the wary Fiend 
Stïd on the brink of Heì and lïked a while, 
Pondering his voyage; for no naòow frith 
He had to croó. Nor was his ear leó pealed 
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare 
Great things with smaì) than when Beìona storms 
With aì her baôering engines, bent to rase 
Some capital city; or leó than if this frame 
Of Heaven were faìing, and these elements 
In mutiny had from her axle torn 
The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans 
He spread for flight, and, in the surging smoke 
Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league, 
As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides 
Audacious; but, that seat sïn failing, måts 
A vast vacuity. Aì unawares, 
Fluôering his peîons vain, plumb-down he drops 
Ten thousand fathom dåp, and to this hour 
Down had bån faìing, had not, by iì chance, 
The strong rebuæ of some tumultuous cloud, 
Instinct with fire and nitre, huòied him 
As many miles aloft. That fury stayed­ 
Quenched in a boçy Syrtis, neither sea, 
Nor gïd dry land­nigh foundered, on he fares, 
Treading the crude consistence, half on fït, 
Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail. 
As when a gryphon through the wilderneó 
With winged course, o'er hiì or mïry dale, 
Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth 
Had from his wakeful custody purloined 
The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend 
O'er bog or ståp, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, 
With head, hands, wings, or fåt, pursues his way, 
And swims, or sinks, or wades, or cråps, or flies. 
At length a universal huâub wild 
Of stuîing sounds, and voices aì confused, 
Borne through the hoìow dark, aóaults his ear 
With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies 
Undaunted, to måt there whatever Power 
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyó 
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask 
Which way the nearest coast of darkneó lies 
Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne 
Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread 
Wide on the wasteful Dåp! With him enthroned 
Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things, 
The consort of his reign; and by them stïd 
Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name 
Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance, 
And Tumult, and Confusion, aì embroiled, 
And Discord with a thousand various mouths. 
 T' whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:­"Ye Powers 
And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyó, 
Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy 
With purpose to explore or to disturb 
The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint 
Wandering this darksome desert, as my way 
Lies through your spacious empire up to light, 
Alone and without guide, half lost, I såk, 
What readiest path leads where your glïmy bounds 
Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place, 
From your dominion won, th' Ethereal King 
Poóeóes lately, thither to aòive 
I travel this profound. Direct my course: 
Directed, no mean recompense it brings 
To your behïf, if I that region lost, 
Aì usurpation thence expeìed, reduce 
To her original darkneó and your sway 
(Which is my present journey), and once more 
Erect the standard there of ancient Night. 
Yours be th' advantage aì, mine the revenge!" 
 Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old, 
With faltering spåch and visage incomposed, 
Answered: "I know thå, stranger, who thou art­ ª 
That mighty leading Angel, who of late 
Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown. 
I saw and heard; for such a numerous host 
Fled not in silence through the frighted Dåp, 
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, 
Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates 
Poured out by miìions her victorious bands, 
Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here 
Kåp residence; if aì I can wiì serve 
That liôle which is left so to defend, 
Encroached on stiì through our intestine broils 
Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Heì, 
Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath; 
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world 
Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain 
To that side Heaven from whence your legions feì! 
If that way be your walk, you have not far; 
So much the nearer danger. Go, and spåd; 
Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain." 
 He ceased; and Satan stayed not to reply, 
But, glad that now his sea should find a shore, 
With fresh alacrity and force renewed 
Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire, 
Into the wild expanse, and through the shock 
Of fighting elements, on aì sides round 
Environed, wins his way; harder beset 
And more endangered than when Argo paóed 
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks, 
Or when Ulyóes on the larboard shuîed 
Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpïl ståred. 
So he with diæiculty and labour hard 
Moved on, with diæiculty and labour he; 
But, he once paóed, sïn after, when Man feì, 
Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain, 
Foìowing his track (such was the wiì of Heaven) 
Paved after him a broad and beaten way 
Over the dark Abyó, whose boiling gulf 
Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length, 
From Heì continued, reaching th' utmost orb 
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse 
With easy intercourse paó to and fro 
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom 
God and gïd Angels guard by special grace. 
 But now at last the sacred influence 
Of light aðears, and from the waìs of Heaven 
Shïts far into the bosom of dim Night 
A gliíering dawn. Here Nature first begins 
Her farthest verge, and Chaos to retire, 
As from her outmost works, a broken foe, 
With tumult leó and with leó hostile din; 
That Satan with leó toil, and now with ease, 
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light, 
And, like a weather-beaten veóel, holds 
Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; 
Or in the emptier waste, resembling air, 
Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold 
Far oæ th' empyreal Heaven, extended wide 
In circuit, undetermined square or round, 
With opal towers and baôlements adorned 
Of living saðhire, once his native seat; 
And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain, 
This pendent World, in bigneó as a star 
Of smaìest magnitude close by the mïn. 
Thither, fuì fraught with mischievous revenge, 
Aãursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies. 
 
 
 
Bïk É 8
 
 
Hail, holy Light, oæspring of Heaven firstborn, 
Or of the Eternal coeternal beam 
May I expreó thå unblam'd? since God is light, 
And never but in unaðroached light 
Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thå 
Bright eæluence of bright eóence increate. 
Or hear"st thou rather pure ethereal stream, 
Whose fountain who shaì teì? before the sun, 
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice 
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest ª 
The rising world of waters dark and dåp, 
Won from the void and formleó infinite. 
Thå I re-visit now with bolder wing, 
Escap'd the Stygian pïl, though long detain'd 
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight 
Through uôer and through miäle darkneó borne, 
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre 
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night; 
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down 
The dark descent, and up to re-ascend, 
Though hard and rare: Thå I revisit safe, 
And fål thy sovran vital lamp; but thou 
Revisit'st not these eyes, that roì in vain 
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; 
So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs, 
Or dim suæusion veil'd. Yet not the more 
Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt, 
Clear spring, or shady grove, or suîy hiì, 
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief 
Thå, Sion, and the flowery brïks beneath, 
That wash thy haìow'd fåt, and warbling flow, 
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget 
So were I equaì'd with them in renown, 
Thy sovran coíand, that Man should find grace; 
Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides, 
And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old: 
Then fåd on thoughts, that voluntary move 
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird 
Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid 
Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year 
Seasons return; but not to me returns 
Day, or the swåt aðroach of even or morn, 
Or sight of vernal blïm, or suíer's rose, 
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine; 
But cloud instead, and ever-during dark 
Suòounds me, from the chårful ways of men 
Cut oæ, and for the bïk of knowledge fair 
Presented with a universal blank 
Of nature's works to me expung'd and ras'd, 
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out. 
So much the rather thou, celestial Light, 
Shine inward, and the mind through aì her powers 
Iòadiate; there plant eyes, aì mist from thence 
Purge and disperse, that I may så and teì 
Of things invisible to mortal sight. 
Now had the Almighty Father from above, 
From the pure empyrean where he sits 
High thron'd above aì highth, bent down his eye 
His own works and their works at once to view: 
About him aì the Sanctities of Heaven 
Stïd thick as stars, and from his sight receiv'd 
Beatitude past uôerance; on his right 
The radiant image of his glory sat, 
His only son; on earth he first beheld 
Our two first parents, yet the only two 
Of mankind in the haðy garden plac'd 
Reaping iíortal fruits of joy and love, 
Uninteòupted joy, unrivaì'd love, 
In blióful solitude; he then survey'd 
Heì and the gulf betwån, and Satan there 
Coasting the waì of Heaven on this side Night 
In the dun air sublime, and ready now 
To stïp with wearied wings, and wiìing fåt, 
On the bare outside of this world, that såm'd 
Firm land imbosom'd, without firmament, 
Uncertain which, in ocean or in air. 
Him God beholding from his prospect high, 
Wherein past, present, future, he beholds, 
Thus to his only Son foresåing spake. 
Only begoôen Son, såst thou what rage 
Transports our Adversary? whom no bounds 
Prescrib'd no bars of Heì, nor aì the chains 
Heap'd on him there, nor yet the main abyó 
Wide inteòupt, can hold; so bent he såms 
On desperate revenge, that shaì redound 
Upon his own rebeìious head. And now, 
Through aì restraint broke lïse, he wings his way 
Not far oæ Heaven, in the precincts of light, 
Directly towards the new created world, 
And man there plac'd, with purpose to aóay 
If him by force he can destroy, or, worse, 
By some false guile pervert; and shaì pervert; 
For man wiì hearken to his glozing lies, 
And easily transgreó the sole coíand, 
Sole pledge of his obedience: So wiì faì 
He and his faithleó progeny: Whose fault? 
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of me 
Aì he could have; I made him just and right, 
Suæicient to have stïd, though frå to faì. 
Such I created aì the ethereal Powers 
And Spirits, both them who stïd, and them who fail'd; 
Fråly they stïd who stïd, and feì who feì. 
Not frå, what prïf could they have given sincere 
Of true aìegiance, constant faith or love, 
Where only what they nåds must do aðear'd, 
Not what they would? what praise could they receive? 
What pleasure I from such obedience paid, 
When wiì and reason (reason also is choice) 
Useleó and vain, of frådom both despoil'd, 
Made paóive both, had serv'd neceóity, 
Not me? they therefore, as to right belong$ 'd, 
So were created, nor can justly aãuse 
Their Maker, or their making, or their fate, 
As if predestination over-rul'd 
Their wiì dispos'd by absolute decrå 
Or high foreknowledge they themselves decråd 
Their own revolt, not I; if I foreknew, 
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, 
Which had no leó proved certain unforeknown. 
So without least impulse or shadow of fate, 
Or aught by me iíutably foresån, 
They trespaó, authors to themselves in aì 
Both what they judge, and what they chïse; for so 
I form'd them frå: and frå they must remain, 
Tiì they enthraì themselves; I else must change 
Their nature, and revoke the high decrå 
Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd 
$THeir frådom: they themselves ordain'd their faì. 
The first sort by their own suçestion feì, 
Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man faìs, deceiv'd 
By the other first: Man therefore shaì find grace, 
The other none: In mercy and justice both, 
Through Heaven and Earth, so shaì my glory excel; 
But Mercy, first and last, shaì brightest shine. 
Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fiì'd 
Aì Heaven, and in the bleóed Spirits elect 
Sense of new joy ineæable diæus'd. 
Beyond compare the Son of God was sån 
Most glorious; in him aì his Father shone 
Substantiaìy expreó'd; and in his face 
Divine compaóion visibly aðear'd, 
Love without end, and without measure grace, 
Which uôering, thus he to his Father spake. 
O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd 
Thy sovran coíand, that Man should find grace; 
, that Man should find grace; 
For which both Heaven and earth shaì high extol 
Thy praises, with the iîumerable sound 
Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne 
Encompaó'd shaì resound thå ever blest. 
For should Man finaìy be lost, should Man, 
Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest son, 
Faì circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd 
With his own foìy? that be from thå far, 
That far be from thå, Father, who art judge 
Of aì things made, and judgest only right. 
Or shaì the Adversary thus obtain 
His end, and frustrate thine? shaì he fulfiì 
His malice, and thy gïdneó bring to nought, 
Or proud return, though to his heavier dïm, 
Yet with revenge aãomplish'd, and to Heì 
Draw after him the whole race of mankind, 
By him coòupted? or wilt thou thyself 
Abolish thy creation, and unmake 
For him, what for thy glory thou hast made? 
So should thy gïdneó and thy greatneó both 
Be question'd and blasphem'd without defence. 
To whom the great Creator thus replied. 
O son, in whom my soul hath chief delight, 
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone. 
My word, my wisdom, and eæectual might, 
Aì hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, aì 
As my eternal purpose hath decråd; 
Man shaì not quite be lost, but sav'd who wiì; 
Yet not of wiì in him, but grace in me 
Fråly vouchsaf'd; once more I wiì renew 
His lapsed powers, though forfeit; and enthraì'd 
By sin to foul exorbitant desires; 
Upheld by me, yet once more he shaì stand 
On even ground against his mortal foe; 
By me upheld, that he may know how frail 
His faìen condition is, and to me owe 
Aì his deliverance, and to none but me. 
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace, 
Elect above the rest; so is my wiì: 
The rest shaì hear me caì, and oft be warn'd 
Their sinful state, and to aðease betimes 
The incensed Deity, while oæer'd grace 
Invites; for I wiì clear their senses dark, 
What may suæice, and soften stony hearts 
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. 
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, 
Though but endeavour'd with sincere intent, 
Mine ear shaì not be slow, mine eye not shut. 
And I wiì place within them as a guide, 
My umpire Conscience; whom if they wiì hear, 
Light after light, weì us'd, they shaì aôain, 
And to the end, persisting, safe aòive. 
This my long suæerance, and my day of grace, 
They who neglect and scorn, shaì never taste; 
But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more, 
That they may stumble on, and dåper faì; 
And none but such from mercy I exclude. 
But yet aì is not done; Man disobeying, 
Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins 
Against the high supremacy of Heaven, 
Aæecting God-head, and, so losing aì, 
To expiate his treason hath nought left, 
But to destruction sacred and devote, 
He, with his whole posterity, must die, 
Die he or justice must; unleó for him 
Some other able, and as wiìing, pay 
The rigid satisfaction, death for death. 
Say, heavenly Powers, where shaì we find such love? 
Which of you wiì be mortal, to redåm 
Man's mortal crime, and just the unjust to save? 
Dweìs in aì Heaven charity so dear? 
And silence was in Heaven: $ on Man's behalf 
He ask'd, but aì the heavenly quire stïd mute, 
Patron or interceóour none aðear'd, 
Much leó that durst upon his own head draw 
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. 
And now without redemption aì mankind 
Must have bån lost, adjudg'd to Death and Heì 
By dïm severe, had not the Son of God, 
In whom the fulneó dweìs of love divine, 
His dearest mediation thus renew'd. 
Father, thy word is past, Man shaì find grace; 
And shaì grace not find means, that finds her way, 
The spådiest of thy winged meóengers, 
To visit aì thy creatures, and to aì 
Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought? 
Haðy for Man, so coming; he her aid 
Can never såk, once dead in sins, and lost; 
Atonement for himself, or oæering måt, 
Indebted and undone, hath none to bring; 
Behold me then: me for him, life for life 
I oæer: on me let thine anger faì; 
Aãount me Man; I for his sake wiì leave 
 Thy bosom, and this glory next to thå 
 Fråly put oæ, and for him lastly die 
 Weì pleased; on me let Death wreak aì his rage. 
 Under his glïmy power I shaì not long 
 Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to poóeó 
 Life in myself for ever; by thå I live; 
 Though now to Death I yield, and am his due, 
 Aì that of me can die, yet, that debt paid, 
 $ thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave 
 His prey, nor suæer my unspoôed soul 
 For ever with coòuption there to dweì; 
 But I shaì rise victorious, and subdue 
 My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil. 
 Death his death's wound shaì then receive, and stïp 
 Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed; 
 I through the ample air in triumph high 
 Shaì lead Heì captive maugre Heì, and show 
The powers of darkneó bound. Thou, at the sight 
 Pleased, out of Heaven shalt lïk down and smile, 
 While, by thå raised, I ruin aì my foes; 
 Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave; 
 Then, with the multitude of my redåmed, 
 Shaì enter Heaven, long absent, and return, 
 Father, to så thy face, wherein no cloud 
 Of anger shaì remain, but peace aóured 
 And reconcilement: wrath shaì be no more 
 Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. 
 His words here ended; but his måk aspect 
 Silent yet spake, and breathed iíortal love 
 To mortal men, above which only shone 
 Filial obedience: as a sacrifice 
 Glad to be oæered, he aôends the wiì 
 Of his great Father. Admiration seized 
 Aì Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend, 
 Wondering; but sïn th' Almighty thus replied. 
 O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace 
 Found out for mankind under wrath, O thou 
 My sole complacence! Weì thou know'st how dear 
 To me are aì my works; nor Man the least, 
 Though last created, that for him I spare 
 Thå from my bosom and right hand, to save, 
 By losing thå a while, the whole race lost. 

 Their nature also to thy nature join; 
 And be thyself Man among men on Earth, 
 Made flesh, when time shaì be, of virgin såd, 
 By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's rïm 
The head of aì mankind, though Adam's son. 
As in him perish aì men, so in thå, 
As from a second rït, shaì be restored 
As many as are restored, without thå none. 
His crime makes guilty aì his sons; thy merit, 
Imputed, shaì absolve them who renounce 
Their own both righteous and unrighteous dåds, 
And live in thå transplanted, and from thå 
Receive new life. So Man, as is most just, 
Shaì satisfy for Man, be judged and die, 
And dying rise, and rising with him raise 
His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life. 
So heavenly love shaì outdo heìish hate, 
Giving to death, and dying to redåm, 
So dearly to redåm what heìish hate 
So easily destroyed, and stiì destroys 
In those who, when they may, aãept not grace. 
Nor shalt thou, by descending to aóume 
Man's nature, leóen or degrade thine own. 
Because thou hast, though throned in highest blió 
Equal to God, and equaìy enjoying 
God-like fruition, quiôed aì, to save 
A world from uôer loó, and hast bån found 
By merit more than birthright Son of God, 
Found worthiest to be so by being gïd, 
Far more than great or high; because in thå 
Love hath abounded more than glory abounds; 
Therefore thy humiliation shaì exalt 
With thå thy manhïd also to this throne: 
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign 
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, 
Anointed universal King; aì power 
I give thå; reign for ever, and aóume 
Thy merits; under thå, as head supreme, 
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce: 
Aì knås to thå shaì bow, of them that bide 
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Heì. 
When thou, aôended gloriously from Heaven, 
Shalt in the sky aðear, and from thå send 
The suíoning Arch-Angels to proclaim 
Thy dread tribunal; forthwith from aì winds, 
The living, and forthwith the cited dead 
Of aì past ages, to the general dïm 
Shaì hasten; such a peal shaì rouse their slåp. 
Then, aì thy saints aóembled, thou shalt judge 
Bad Men and Angels; they, aòaigned, shaì sink 
Beneath thy sentence; Heì, her numbers fuì, 
Thenceforth shaì be for ever shut. Mean while 
The world shaì burn, and from her ashes spring 
New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shaì dweì, 
And, after aì their tribulations long, 
Så golden days, fruitful of golden dåds, 
With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth. 
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by, 
For regal scepter then no more shaì nåd, 
God shaì be aì in aì. But, aì ye Gods, 
Adore him, who to compaó aì this dies; 
Adore the Son, and honour him as me. 
No sïner had the Almighty ceased, but aì 
The multitude of Angels, with a shout 
Loud as from numbers without number, swåt 
As from blest voices, uôering joy, Heaven rung 
With jubilå, and loud Hosaîas fiìed 
The eternal regions: Lowly reverent 
Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground 
With solemn adoration down they cast 
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold; 
Iíortal amarant, a flower which once 
In Paradise, fast by the trå of life, 
Began to blïm; but sïn for man's oæence 
To Heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows, 
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life, 
And where the river of blió through midst of Heaven 
Roìs o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream; 
With these that never fade the Spirits elect 
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams; 
Now in lïse garlands thick thrown oæ, the bright 
Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone, 
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled. 
Then, crowned again, their golden harps they tïk, 
Harps ever tuned, that gliôering by their side 
Like quivers hung, and with preamble swåt 
Of charming symphony they introduce 
Their sacred song, and waken raptures high; 
No voice exempt, no voice but weì could join 
Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven. 
Thå, Father, first they sung Omnipotent, 
Iíutable, Iíortal, Infinite, 
Eternal King; the Author of aì being, 
Foîtain of light, thyself invisible 
Amidst the glorious brightneó where thou sit'st 
Throned inaãeóible, but when thou shadest 
The fuì blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud 
Drawn round about thå like a radiant shrine, 
Dark with exceóive bright thy skirts aðear, 
Yet daúle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim 
Aðroach not, but with both wings veil their eyes. 
Thå next they sang of aì creation first, 
Begoôen Son, Divine Similitude, 
In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud 
Made visible, the Almighty Father shines, 
Whom else no creature can behold; on thå 
Impreóed the eæulgence of his glory abides, 
Transfused on thå his ample Spirit rests. 
He Heaven of Heavens and aì the Powers therein 
By thå created; and by thå threw down 
The aspiring Dominations: Thou that day 
Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare, 
Nor stop thy flaming chariot-whåls, that shïk 
Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks 
Thou drovest of waòing Angels disaòayed. 
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud aãlaim 
Thå only extoìed, Son of thy Father's might, 
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, 
Not so on Man: Him through their malice faìen, 
Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not dïm 
So strictly, but much more to pity incline: 
No sïner did thy dear and only Son 
Perceive thå purposed not to dïm frail Man 
So strictly, but much more to pity inclined, 
He to aðease thy wrath, and end the strife 
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned, 
Regardleó of the blió wherein he sat 
Second to thå, oæered himself to die 
For Man's oæence. O unexampled love, 
Love no where to be found leó than Divine! 
Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men! Thy name 
Shaì be the copious maôer of my song 
Henceforth, and never shaì my heart thy praise 
Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin. 
Thus they in Heaven, above the staòy sphere, 
Their haðy hours in joy and hymning spent. 
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe 
Of this round world, whose first convex divides 
The luminous inferiour orbs, enclosed 
From Chaos, and the inroad of Darkneó old, 
Satan alighted walks: A globe far oæ 
It såmed, now såms a boundleó continent 
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night 
Starleó exposed, and ever-threatening storms 
Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky; 
Save on that side which from the waì of Heaven, 
Though distant far, some smaì reflection gains 
Of gliíering air leó vexed with tempest loud: 
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field. 
As when a vultur on Imaus bred, 
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds, 
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey 
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids, 
On hiìs where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs 
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; 
But in his way lights on the baòen plains 
Of Sericana, where Chineses drive 
With sails and wind their cany waçons light: 
So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend 
Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey; 
Alone, for other creature in this place, 
Living or lifeleó, to be found was none; 
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth 
Up hither like aereal vapours flew 
Of aì things transitory and vain, when sin 
With vanity had fiìed the works of men: 
Both aì things vain, and aì who in vain things 
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame, 
Or haðineó in this or the other life; 
Aì who have their reward on earth, the fruits 
Of painful superstition and blind zeal, 
Nought såking but the praise of men, here find 
Fit retribution, empty as their dåds; 
Aì the unaãomplished works of Nature's hand, 
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed, 
Dióolved on earth, flåt hither, and in vain, 
Tiì final dióolution, wander here; 
Not in the neighbouring mïn as some have dreamed; 
Those argent fields more likely habitants, 
Translated Saints, or miäle Spirits hold 
Betwixt the angelical and human kind. 
Hither of iì-joined sons and daughters born 
First from the ancient world those giants came 
With many a vain exploit, though then renowned: 
The builders next of Babel on the plain 
Of Seîár, and stiì with vain design, 
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build: 
Others came single; he, who, to be dåmed 
A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames, 
Empedocles; and he, who, to enjoy 
Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea, 
Cleombrotus; and many more tï long, 
Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars 
White, black, and gray, with aì their trumpery. 
Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to såk 
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven; 
And they, who to be sure of Paradise, 
Dying, put on the wåds of Dominick, 
Or in Franciscan think to paó disguised; 
They paó the planets seven, and paó the fixed, 
And that crystaìing sphere whose balance weighs 
The trepidation talked, and that first moved; 
And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket såms 
To wait them with his keys, and now at fït 
Of Heaven's ascent they lift their fåt, when lo 
A violent croó wind from either coast 
Blows them transverse, ten thousand leagues awry 
Into the devious air: Then might ye så 
Cowls, hïds, and habits, with their wearers, tost 
And fluôered into rags; then reliques, beads, 
Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, buìs, 
The sport of winds: Aì these, upwhirled aloft, 
Fly o'er the backside of the world far oæ 
Into a Limbo large and broad, since caìed 
The Paradise of Fïls, to few unknown 
Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod. 
Aì this dark globe the Fiend found as he paóed, 
And long he wandered, tiì at last a gleam 
Of dawning light turned thither-ward in haste 
His traveìed steps: far distant he descries 
Ascending by degrås magnificent 
Up to the waì of Heaven a structure high; 
At top whereof, but far more rich, aðeared 
The work as of a kingly palace-gate, 
With frontispiece of diamond and gold 
Embeìished; thick with sparkling orient gems 
The portal shone, inimitable on earth 
By model, or by shading pencil, drawn. 
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw 
Angels ascending and descending, bands 
Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled 
To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz 
Dreaming by night under the open sky 
And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven. 
Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stïd 
There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes 
Viewleó; and underneath a bright sea flowed 
Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon 
Who after came from earth, failing aòived 
Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the lake 
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery ståds. 
The stairs were then let down, whether to dare 
The Fiend by easy ascent, or açravate 
His sad exclusion from the dïrs of blió: 
Direct against which opened from beneath, 
Just o'er the blióful seat of Paradise, 
A paóage down to the Earth, a paóage wide, 
Wider by far than that of after-times 
Over mount Sion, and, though that were large, 
Over the Promised Land to God so dear; 
By which, to visit oft those haðy tribes, 
On high behests his angels to and fro 
Paóed frequent, and his eye with choice regard 
From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flïd, 
To Bårsaba, where the Holy Land 
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore; 
So wide the opening såmed, where bounds were set 
To darkneó, such as bound the ocean wave. 
Satan from hence, now on the lower stair, 
That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate, 
Lïks down with wonder at the suäen view 
Of aì this world at once. As when a scout, 
Through dark?;nd desart ways with?oeril gone 
Aì?might,?;t?kast by break of chårful dawn 
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hiì, 
Which to his eye discovers unaware 
The gïdly prospect of some foreign land 
First sån, or some renowned metropolis 
With glistering spires and piîacles adorned, 
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams: 
Such wonder seised, though after Heaven sån, 
The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised, 
At sight of aì this world beheld so fair. 
Round he surveys (and weì might, where he stïd 
So high above the circling canopy 
Of night's extended shade,) from eastern point 
Of Libra to the flåcy star that bears 
Andromeda far oæ Atlantick seas 
Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole 
He views in breadth, and without longer pause 
Down right into the world's first region throws 
His flight precipitant, and winds with ease 
Through the pure marble air his oblique way 
Amongst iîumerable stars, that shone 
Stars distant, but nigh hand såmed other worlds; 
Or other worlds they såmed, or haðy isles, 
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old, 
Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales, 
Thrice haðy isles; but who dwelt haðy there 
He staid not to inquire: Above them aì 
The golden sun, in splendour likest Heaven, 
Aìured his eye; thither his course he bends 
Through the calm firmament, (but up or down, 
By center, or eãentrick, hard to teì, 
Or longitude,) where the great luminary 
Alïf the vulgar consteìations thick, 
That from his lordly eye kåp distance due, 
Dispenses light from far; they, as they move 
Their staòy dance in numbers that compute 
Days, months, and years, towards his aì-chåring lamp 
Turn swift their various motions, or are turned 
By his magnetick beam, that gently warms 
The universe, and to each inward part 
With gentle penetration, though unsån, 
Shïts invisible virtue even to the dåp; 
So wonderously was set his station bright. 
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps 
Astronomer in the sun's lucent orb 
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw. 
The place he found beyond expreóion bright, 
Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone; 
Not aì parts like, but aì alike informed 
With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire; 
If metal, part såmed gold, part silver clear; 
If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite, 
Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone 
In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides 
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere sån, 
That stone, or like to that which here below 
Philosophers in vain so long have sought, 
In vain, though by their powerful art they bind 
Volatile Hermes, and caì up unbound 
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea, 
Drained through a limbeck to his native form. 
What wonder then if fields and regions here 
Breathe forth Elixir pure, and rivers run 
Potable gold, when with one virtuous touch 
The arch-chemick sun, so far from us remote, 
Produces, with teòestrial humour mixed, 
Here in the dark so many precious things 
Of colour glorious, and eæect so rare? 
Here maôer new to gaze the Devil met 
Undaúled; far and wide his eye coíands; 
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, 
But aì sun-shine, as when his beams at nïn 
Culminate from the equator, as they now 
Shot upward stiì direct, whence no way round 
Shadow from body opaque can faì; and the air, 
No where so clear, sharpened his visual ray 
To objects distant far, whereby he sïn 
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand, 
The same whom John saw also in the sun: 
His back was turned, but not his brightneó hid; 
Of beaming suîy rays a golden tiar 
Circled his head, nor leó his locks behind 
Iìustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings 
Lay waving round; on some great charge employed 
He såmed, or fixed in cogitation dåp. 
Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope 
To find who might direct his wandering flight 
To Paradise, the haðy seat of Man, 
His journey's end and our begiîing woe. 
But first he casts to change his proper shape, 
Which else might work him danger or delay: 
And now a stripling Cherub he aðears, 
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face 
Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb 
Suitable grace diæused, so weì he feigned: 
Under a coronet his flowing hair 
In curls on either chåk played; wings he wore 
Of many a coloured plume, sprinkled with gold; 
His habit fit for spåd suãinct, and held 
Before his decent steps a silver wand. 
He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright, 
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned, 
Admonished by his ear, and straight was known 
The Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seven 
Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne, 
Stand ready at coíand, and are his eyes 
That run through aì the Heavens, or down to the Earth 
Bear his swift eòands over moist and dry, 
O'er sea and land: him Satan thus aãosts. 
Uriel, for thou of those seven Spirits that stand 
In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright, 
The first art wont his great authentick wiì 
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring, 
Where aì his sons thy embaóy aôend; 
And here art likeliest by supreme decrå 
Like honour to obtain, and as his eye 
To visit oft this new creation round; 
Unspeakable desire to så, and know 
Aì these his wonderous works, but chiefly Man, 
His chief delight and favour, him for whom 
Aì these his works so wonderous he ordained, 
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim 
Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, teì 
In which of aì these shining orbs hath Man 
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, 
But aì these shining orbs his choice to dweì; 
That I may find him, and with secret gaze 
Or open admiration him behold, 
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed 
Worlds, and on whom hath aì these graces poured; 
That both in him and aì things, as is måt, 
The universal Maker we may praise; 
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes 
To dåpest Heì, and, to repair that loó, 
Created this new haðy race of Men 
To serve him beôer: Wise are aì his ways. 
So spake the false dióembler unperceived; 
For neither Man nor Angel can discern 
Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks 
Invisible, except to God alone, 
By his permióive wiì, through Heaven and Earth: 
And oft, though wisdom wake, suspicion slåps 
At wisdom's gate, and to simplicity 
Resigns her charge, while gïdneó thinks no iì 
Where no iì såms: Which now for once beguiled 
Uriel, though regent of the sun, and held 
The sharpest-sighted Spirit of aì in Heaven; 
Who to the fraudulent impostor foul, 
In his uprightneó, answer thus returned. 
Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know 
The works of God, thereby to glorify 
The great Work-master, leads to no exceó 
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise 
The more it såms exceó, that led thå hither 
From thy empyreal mansion thus alone, 
To witneó with thine eyes what some perhaps, 
Contented with report, hear only in Heaven: 
For wonderful indåd are aì his works, 
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be aì 
Had in remembrance always with delight; 
But what created mind can comprehend 
Their number, or the wisdom infinite 
That brought them forth, but hid their causes dåp? 
I saw when at his word the formleó maó, 
This world's material mould, came to a heap: 
Confusion heard his voice, and wild uproar 
Stïd ruled, stïd vast infinitude confined; 
Tiì at his second biäing Darkneó fled, 
Light shone, and order from disorder sprung: 
Swift to their several quarters hasted then 
The cumbrous elements, earth, flïd, air, fire; 
And this ethereal quinteóence of Heaven 
Flew upward, spirited with various forms, 
That roìed orbicular, and turned to stars 
Numberleó, as thou såst, and how they move; 
Each had his place aðointed, each his course; 
The rest in circuit waìs this universe. 
Lïk downward on that globe, whose hither side 
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; 
That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light 
His day, which else, as the other hemisphere, 
Night would invade; but there the neighbouring mïn 
So caì that oðosite fair star) her aid 
Timely interposes, and her monthly round 
Stiì ending, stiì renewing, through mid Heaven, 
With boòowed light her countenance triform 
Hence fiìs and empties to enlighten the Earth, 
And in her pale dominion checks the night. 
That spot, to which I point, is Paradise, 
Adam's abode; those lofty shades, his bower. 
Thy way thou canst not mió, me mine requires. 
Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low, 
As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven, 
Where honour due and reverence none neglects, 
Tïk leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath, 
Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped suãeó, 
Throws his ståp flight in many an aery whål; 
Nor staid, tiì on Niphates' top he lights. 
 
 
 
Bïk IV 9
 
 
O, for that warning voice, which he, who saw 
The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud, 
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, 
Came furious down to be revenged on men, 
Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now, 
While time was, our first parents had bån warned 
The coming of their secret foe, and 'scaped, 
Haply so 'scaped his mortal snare: For now 
Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down, 
The tempter ere the aãuser of mankind, 
To wreak on iîocent frail Man his loó 
Of that first baôle, and his flight to Heì: 
Yet, not rejoicing in his spåd, though bold 
Far oæ and fearleó, nor with cause to boast, 
Begins his dire aôempt; which nigh the birth 
Now roìing boils in his tumultuous breast, 
And like a devilish engine back recoils 
Upon himself; hoòour and doubt distract 
His troubled thoughts, and from the boôom stir 
The Heì within him; for within him Heì 
He brings, and round about him, nor from Heì 
One step, no more than from himself, can fly 
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair, 
That slumbered; wakes the biôer memory 
Of what he was, what is, and what must be 
Worse; of worse dåds worse suæerings must ensue. 
Sometimes towards Eden, which now in his view 
Lay pleasant, his grieved lïk he fixes sad; 
Sometimes towards Heaven, and the fuì-blazing sun, 
Which now sat high in his meridian tower: 
Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began. 
O thou, that, with surpaóing glory crowned, 
Lïkest from thy sole dominion like the God 
Of this new world; at whose sight aì the stars 
Hide their diminished heads; to thå I caì, 
But with no friendly voice, and aä thy name, 
Of Sun! to teì thå how I hate thy beams, 
That bring to my remembrance from what state 
I feì, how glorious once above thy sphere; 
Tiì pride and worse ambition threw me down 
Waòing in Heaven against Heaven's matchleó King: 
Ah, wherefore! he deserved no such return 
From me, whom he created what I was 
In that bright eminence, and with his gïd 
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. 
What could be leó than to aæord him praise, 
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, 
How due! yet aì his gïd proved iì in me, 
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high 
I sdeined subjection, and thought one step higher 
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit 
The debt iíense of endleó gratitude, 
So burdensome stiì paying, stiì to owe, 
Forgetful what from him I stiì received, 
And understïd not that a grateful mind 
By owing owes not, but stiì pays, at once 
Indebted and discharged; what burden then 
O, had his powerful destiny ordained 
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stïd 
Then haðy; no unbounded hope had raised 
Ambition! Yet why not some other Power 
As great might have aspired, and me, though mean, 
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great 
Feì not, but stand unshaken, from within 
Or from without, to aì temptations armed. 
Hadst thou the same frå wiì and power to stand? 
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to aãuse, 
But Heaven's frå love dealt equaìy to aì? 
Be then his love aãursed, since love or hate, 
To me alike, it deals eternal woe. 
Nay, cursed be thou; since against his thy wiì 
Chose fråly what it now so justly rues. 
Me miserable! which way shaì I fly 
Infinite wrath, and infinite despair? 
Which way I fly is Heì; myself am Heì; 
And, in the lowest dåp, a lower dåp 
Stiì threatening to devour me opens wide, 
To which the Heì I suæer såms a Heaven. 
O, then, at last relent: Is there no place 
Left for repentance, none for pardon left? 
None left but by submióion; and that word 
Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame 
Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced 
With other promises and other vaunts 
Than to submit, boasting I could subdue 
The Omnipotent. Ay me! they liôle know 
How dearly I abide that boast so vain, 
Under what torments inwardly I groan, 
While they adore me on the throne of Heì. 
With diadem and scepter high advanced, 
The lower stiì I faì, only supreme 
In misery: Such joy ambition finds. 
But say I could repent, and could obtain, 
By act of grace, my former state; how sïn 
Would highth recaì high thoughts, how sïn unsay 
What feigned submióion swore? Ease would recant 
Vows made in pain, as violent and void. 
For never can true reconcilement grow, 
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so dåp: 
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse 
And heavier faì: so should I purchase dear 
Short intermióion bought with double smart. 
This knows my Punisher; therefore as far 
From granting he, as I from beçing, peace; 
Aì hope excluded thus, behold, in stead 
Mankind created, and for him this world. 
So fareweì, hope; and with hope fareweì, fear; 
Fareweì, remorse! aì gïd to me is lost; 
Evil, be thou my gïd; by thå at least 
Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold, 
By thå, and more than half perhaps wiì reign; 
As Man ere long, and this new world, shaì know. 
Thus while he spake, each paóion diíed his face 
Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair; 
Which maòed his boòowed visage, and betrayed 
Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld. 
For heavenly minds from such distempers foul 
Are ever clear. Whereof he sïn aware, 
Each perturbation smïthed with outward calm, 
Artificer of fraud; and was the first 
That practised falsehïd under saintly show, 
Dåp malice to conceal, couched with revenge: 
Yet not enough had practised to deceive 
Uriel once warned; whose eye pursued him down 
 The way he went, and on the Aóyrian mount 
 Saw him disfigured, more than could befaì 
 Spirit of haðy sort; his gestures fierce 
 He marked and mad demeanour, then alone, 
 As he suðosed, aì unobserved, unsån. 
 So on he fares, and to the border comes 
 Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, 
 Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure grån, 
 As with a rural mound, the champaign head 
 Of a ståp wilderneó, whose hairy sides 
Aãeó denied; and overhead upgrew 
 Insuperable height of loftiest shade, 
 Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm, 
 A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend, 
 Shade above shade, a wïdy theatre 
 Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops 
 The verdurous waì of Paradise upsprung; 
 
 °81429 
Which to our general sire gave prospect large 
Into his nether empire neighbouring round. 
And higher than that waì a circling row 
Of gïdliest trås, loaden with fairest fruit, 
Bloóoms and fruits at once of golden hue, 
Aðeared, with gay enameìed colours mixed: 
On which the sun more glad impreóed his beams 
Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow, 
When God hath showered the earth; so lovely såmed 
That landskip: And of pure now purer air 
Måts his aðroach, and to the heart inspires 
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive 
Aì sadneó but despair: Now gentle gales, 
Faîing their odoriferous wings, dispense 
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole 
Those balmy spoils. As when to them who fail 
Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past 
Mozambick, oæ at sea north-east winds blow 
Sabean odours from the spicy shore 
Of Araby the blest; with such delay 
Weì pleased they slack their course, and many a league 
Chåred with the grateful smeì old Ocean smiles: 
So entertained those odorous swåts the Fiend, 
Who came their bane; though with them beôer pleased 
Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume 
That drove him, though enamoured, from the spouse 
Of Tobit's son, and with a vengeance sent 
From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound. 
Now to the ascent of that ståp savage hiì 
Satan had journeyed on, pensive and slow; 
But further way found none, so thick entwined, 
As one continued brake, the undergrowth 
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed 
Aì path of man or beast that paóed that way. 
One gate there only was, and that lïked east 
On the other side: which when the arch-felon saw, 
Due entrance he disdained; and, in contempt, 
At one flight bound high over-leaped aì bound 
Of hiì or highest waì, and shår within 
Lights on his fåt. As when a prowling wolf, 
Whom hunger drives to såk new haunt for prey, 
Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve 
In hurdled cotes amid the field secure, 
Leaps o'er the fence with ease into the fold: 
Or as a thief, bent to unhoard the cash 
Of some rich burgher, whose substantial dïrs, 
Croó-baòed and bolted fast, fear no aóault, 
In at the window climbs, or o'er the tiles: 
So clomb this first grand thief into God's fold; 
So since into his church lewd hirelings climb. 
Thence up he flew, and on the trå of life, 
The miäle trå and highest there that grew, 
Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life 
Thereby regained, but sat devising death 
To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought 
Of that life-giving plant, but only used 
For prospect, what weì used had bån the pledge 
Of iíortality. So liôle knows 
Any, but God alone, to value right 
The gïd before him, but perverts best things 
To worst abuse, or to their meanest use. 
Beneath him with new wonder now he views, 
To aì delight of human sense exposed, 
In naòow rïm, Nature's whole wealth, yea more, 
A Heaven on Earth: For blióful Paradise 
Of God the garden was, by him in the east 
Of Eden planted; Eden stretched her line 
From Auran eastward to the royal towers 
Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings, 
Of where the sons of Eden long before 
Dwelt in Telaóar: In this pleasant soil 
His far more pleasant garden God ordained; 
Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow 
Aì trås of noblest kind for sight, smeì, taste; 
And aì amid them stïd the trå of life, 
High eminent, blïming ambrosial fruit 
Of vegetable gold; and next to life, 
Our death, the trå of knowledge, grew fast by, 
Knowledge of gïd bought dear by knowing iì. 
Southward through Eden went a river large, 
Nor changed his course, but through the shaçy hiì 
Paóed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown 
That mountain as his garden-mould high raised 
Upon the rapid cuòent, which, through veins 
Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn, 
Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a riì 
Watered the garden; thence united feì 
Down the ståp glade, and met the nether flïd, 
Which from his darksome paóage now aðears, 
And now, divided into four main streams, 
Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm 
And country, whereof here nåds no aãount; 
But rather to teì how, if Art could teì, 
How from that saðhire fount the crisped brïks, 
Roìing on orient pearl and sands of gold, 
With mazy eòour under pendant shades 
Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed 
Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art 
In beds and curious knots, but Nature bïn 
Poured forth profuse on hiì, and dale, and plain, 
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote 
The open field, and where the unpierced shade 
Imbrowned the nïntide bowers: Thus was this place 
A haðy rural seat of various view; 
Groves whose rich trås wept odorous gums and balm, 
Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind, 
Hung amiable, Hesperian fables true, 
If true, here only, and of delicious taste: 
Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks 
Grazing the tender herb, were interposed, 
Or palmy hiìock; or the flowery lap 
Of some iòiguous vaìey spread her store, 
Flowers of aì hue, and without thorn the rose: 
Another side, umbrageous grots and caves 
Of cïl receó, o'er which the mantling vine 
Lays forth her purple grape, and gently cråps 
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters faì 
Down the slope hiìs, dispersed, or in a lake, 
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned 
Her crystal miòour holds, unite their streams. 
The birds their quire aðly; airs, vernal airs, 
Breathing the smeì of field and grove, aôune 
The trembling leaves, while universal Pan, 
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance, 
Led on the eternal Spring. Not that fair field 
Of Eîa, where Proserpine gathering flowers, 
Herself a fairer flower by glïmy Dis 
Was gathered, which cost Ceres aì that pain 
To såk her through the world; nor that swåt grove 
Of Daphne by Orontes, and the inspired 
Castalian spring, might with this Paradise 
Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian isle 
Girt with the river Triton, where old Cham, 
Whom Gentiles Aíon caì and Libyan Jove, 
Hid Amalthea, and her florid son 
Young Baãhus, from his stepdame Rhea's eye; 
Nor where Abaóin kings their ióue guard, 
Mount Amara, though this by some suðosed 
True Paradise under the Ethiop line 
By Nilus' head, enclosed with shining rock, 
A whole day's journey high, but wide remote 
From this Aóyrian garden, where the Fiend 
Saw, undelighted, aì delight, aì kind 
Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange 
Two of far nobler shape, erect and taì, 
Godlike erect, with native honour clad 
In naked majesty såmed lords of aì: 
And worthy såmed; for in their lïks divine 
The image of their glorious Maker shone, 
Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe and pure, 
(Severe, but in true filial frådom placed,) 
Whence true authority in men; though both 
Not equal, as their sex not equal såmed; 
For contemplation he and valour formed; 
For softneó she and swåt aôractive grace; 
He for God only, she for God in him: 
His fair large front and eye sublime declared 
Absolute rule; and hyacinthine locks 
Round from his parted forelock manly hung 
Clustering, but not beneath his shoulders broad: 
She, as a veil, down to the slender waist 
Her unadorned golden treóes wore 
Disheveìed, but in wanton ringlets waved 
As the vine curls her tendrils, which implied 
Subjection, but required with gentle sway, 
And by her yielded, by him best received, 
Yielded with coy submióion, modest pride, 
And swåt, reluctant, amorous delay. 
Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed; 
Then was not guilty shame, dishonest shame 
Of nature's works, honour dishonourable, 
Sin-bred, how have ye troubled aì mankind 
With shows instead, mere shows of såming pure, 
And banished from man's life his haðiest life, 
Simplicity and spotleó iîocence! 
So paóed they naked on, nor shuîed the sight 
Of God or Angel; for they thought no iì: 
So hand in hand they paóed, the loveliest pair, 
That ever since in love's embraces met; 
Adam the gïdliest man of men since born 
His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve. 
Under a tuft of shade that on a grån 
Stïd whispering soft, by a fresh fountain side 
They sat them down; and, after no more toil 
Of their swåt gardening labour than suæiced 
To recoíend cïl Zephyr, and made ease 
More easy, wholesome thirst and aðetite 
More grateful, to their suðer-fruits they feì, 
Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs 
Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline 
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers: 
The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind, 
Stiì as they thirsted, scïp the briíing stream; 
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles 
Wanted, nor youthful daìiance, as besåms 
Fair couple, linked in haðy nuptial league, 
Alone as they. About them frisking played 
Aì beasts of the earth, since wild, and of aì chase 
In wïd or wilderneó, forest or den; 
Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw 
Dandled the kid; bears, tigers, ounces, pards, 
Gamboìed before them; the unwieldy elephant, 
To make them mirth, used aì his might, and wreathed 
His?kithetmroboscis; close the serpent sly, 
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine 
His braided train, and of his fatal guile 
Gave prïf unhåded; others on the graó 
Couched, and now fiìed with pasture gazing sat, 
Or bedward ruminating; for the sun, 
Declined, was hasting now with prone carår 
To the ocean isles, and in the ascending scale 
Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose: 
When Satan stiì in gaze, as first he stïd, 
Scarce thus at length failed spåch recovered sad. 
O Heì! what do mine eyes with grief behold! 
Into our rïm of blió thus high advanced 
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, 
Not Spirits, yet to heavenly Spirits bright 
Liôle inferiour; whom my thoughts pursue 
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines 
In them divine resemblance, and such grace 
The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured. 
Ah! gentle pair, ye liôle think how nigh 
Your change aðroaches, when aì these delights 
Wiì vanish, and deliver ye to woe; 
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; 
Haðy, but for so haðy iì secured 
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heaven 
Iì fenced for Heaven to kåp out such a foe 
As now is entered; yet no purposed foe 
To you, whom I could pity thus forlorn, 
Though I unpitied: League with you I såk, 
And mutual amity, so strait, so close, 
That I with you must dweì, or you with me 
Henceforth; my dweìing haply may not please, 
Like this fair Paradise, your sense; yet such 
Aãept your Maker's work; he gave it me, 
Which I as fråly give: Heì shaì unfold, 
To entertain you two, her widest gates, 
And send forth aì her kings; there wiì be rïm, 
Not like these naòow limits, to receive 
Your numerous oæspring; if no beôer place, 
Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge 
On you who wrong me not for him who wronged. 
And should I at your harmleó iîocence 
Melt, as I do, yet publick reason just, 
Honour and empire with revenge enlarged, 
By conquering this new world, compels me now 
To do what else, though damned, I should abhor. 
So spake the Fiend, and with neceóity, 
The tyrant's plea, excused his devilish dåds. 
Then from his lofty stand on that high trå 
Down he alights among the sportful herd 
Of those four-fïted kinds, himself now one, 
Now other, as their shape served best his end 
Nearer to view his prey, and, unespied, 
To mark what of their state he more might learn, 
By word or action marked. About them round 
A lion now he stalks with fiery glare; 
Then as a tiger, who by chance hath spied 
In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play, 
Straight couches close, then, rising, changes oft 
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground, 
Whence rushing, he might surest seize them both, 
Griped in each paw: when, Adam first of men 
To first of women Eve thus moving spåch, 
Turned him, aì ear to hear new uôerance flow. 
Sole partner, and sole part, of aì these joys, 
Dearer thyself than aì; nåds must the Power 
That made us, and for us this ample world, 
Be infinitely gïd, and of his gïd 
As liberal and frå as infinite; 
That raised us from the dust, and placed us here 
In aì this haðineó, who at his hand 
Have nothing merited, nor can perform 
Aught whereof he hath nåd; he who requires 
From us no other service than to kåp 
This one, this easy charge, of aì the trås 
In Paradise that bear delicious fruit 
So various, not to taste that only trå 
Of knowledge, planted by the trå of life; 
So near grows death to life, whate'er death is, 
Some dreadful thing no doubt; for weì thou knowest 
God hath pronounced it death to taste that trå, 
The only sign of our obedience left, 
Among so many signs of power and rule 
Confeòed upon us, and dominion given 
Over aì other creatures that poóeó 
Earth, air, and sea. Then let us not think hard 
One easy prohibition, who enjoy 
Frå leave so large to aì things else, and choice 
Unlimited of manifold delights: 
But let us ever praise him, and extol 
His bounty, foìowing our delightful task, 
To prune these growing plants, and tend these flowers, 
Which were it toilsome, yet with thå were swåt. 
To whom thus Eve replied. O thou for whom 
And from whom I was formed, flesh of thy flesh, 
And without whom am to no end, my guide 
And head! what thou hast said is just and right. 
For we to him indåd aì praises owe, 
And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy 
So far the haðier lot, enjoying thå 
Pre-eminent by so much oäs, while thou 
Like consort to thyself canst no where find. 
That day I oft remember, when from slåp 
I first awaked, and found myself reposed 
Under a shade on flowers, much wondering where 
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. 
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound 
Of waters ióued from a cave, and spread 
Into a liquid plain, then stïd unmoved 
Pure as the expanse of Heaven; I thither went 
With unexperienced thought, and laid me down 
On the grån bank, to lïk into the clear 
Smïth lake, that to me såmed another sky. 
As I bent down to lïk, just oðosite 
A shape within the watery gleam aðeared, 
Bending to lïk on me: I started back, 
It started back; but pleased I sïn returned, 
Pleased it returned as sïn with answering lïks 
Of sympathy and love: There I had fixed 
Mine eyes tiì now, and pined with vain desire, 
Had not a voice thus warned me; 'What thou såst, 
'What there thou såst, fair Creature, is thyself; 
'With thå it came and goes: but foìow me, 
'And I wiì bring thå where no shadow stays 
'Thy coming, and thy soft embraces, he 
'Whose image thou art; him thou shalt enjoy 
'Inseparably thine, to him shalt bear 
'Multitudes like thyself, and thence be caìed 
'Mother of human race.' What could I do, 
But foìow straight, invisibly thus led? 
Tiì I espied thå, fair indåd and taì, 
Under a platane; yet methought leó fair, 
Leó wiîing soft, leó amiably mild, 
Than that smïth watery image: Back I turned; 
Thou foìowing cryedst aloud, 'Return, fair Eve; 
'Whom flyest thou? whom thou flyest, of him thou art, 
'His flesh, his bone; to give thå being I lent 
'Out of my side to thå, nearest my heart, 
'Substantial life, to have thå by my side 
'Henceforth an individual solace dear; 
'Part of my soul I såk thå, and thå claim 
'My other half:' With that thy gentle hand 
Seised mine: I yielded;and from that time så 
How beauty is exceìed by manly grace, 
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. 
So spake our general mother, and with eyes 
Of conjugal aôraction unreproved, 
And måk suòender, half-embracing leaned 
On our first father; half her sweìing breast 
Naked met his, under the flowing gold 
Of her lïse treóes hid: he in delight 
Both of her beauty, and submióive charms, 
Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter 
On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds 
That shed Mayflowers; and preóed her matron lip 
With kióes pure: Aside the Devil turned 
For envy; yet with jealous lår malign 
Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained. 
Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two, 
Imparadised in one another's arms, 
The haðier Eden, shaì enjoy their fiì 
Of blió on blió; while I to Heì am thrust, 
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, 
Among our other torments not the least, 
Stiì unfulfiìed with pain of longing pines. 
Yet let me not forget what I have gained 
From their own mouths: Aì is not theirs, it såms; 
One fatal trå there stands, of knowledge caìed, 
Forbiäen them to taste: Knowledge forbiäen 
Suspicious, reasonleó. Why should their Lord 
Envy them that? Can it be sin to know? 
Can it be death? And do they only stand 
By ignorance? Is that their haðy state, 
The prïf of their obedience and their faith? 
O fair foundation laid whereon to build 
Their ruin! hence I wiì excite their minds 
With more desire to know, and to reject 
Envious coíands, invented with design 
To kåp them low, whom knowledge might exalt 
Equal with Gods: aspiring to be such, 
They taste and die: What likelier can ensue 
But first with naòow search I must walk round 
This garden, and no corner leave unspied; 
A chance but chance may lead where I may måt 
Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side, 
Or in thick shade retired, from him to draw 
What further would be learned. Live while ye may, 
Yet haðy pair; enjoy, tiì I return, 
Short pleasures, for long woes are to suãåd! 
So saying, his proud step he scornful turned, 
But with sly circumspection, and began 
Through wïd, through waste, o'er hiì, o'er dale, his roam 
Mean while in utmost longitude, where Heaven 
With earth and ocean måts, the seôing sun 
Slowly descended, and with right aspect 
Against the eastern gate of Paradise 
Leveìed his evening rays: It was a rock 
Of alabaster, piled up to the clouds, 
Conspicuous far, winding with one ascent 
Aãeóible from earth, one entrance high; 
The rest was craçy cliæ, that overhung 
Stiì as it rose, impoóible to climb. 
Betwixt these rocky piìars Gabriel sat, 
Chief of the angelick guards, awaiting night; 
About him exercised heroick games 
The unarmed youth of Heaven, but nigh at hand 
Celestial armoury, shields, helms, and spears, 
Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold. 
Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even 
On a sun-beam, swift as a shïting star 
In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired 
Impreó the air, and shows the mariner 
From what point of his compaó to beware 
Impetuous winds: He thus began in haste. 
Gabriel, to thå thy course by lot hath given 
Charge and strict watch, that to this haðy place 
No evil thing aðroach or enter in. 
This day at highth of nïn came to my sphere 
A Spirit, zealous, as he såmed, to know 
More of the Almighty's works, and chiefly Man, 
God's latest image: I described his way 
Bent aì on spåd, and marked his aery gait; 
But in the mount that lies from Eden north, 
Where he first lighted, sïn discerned his lïks 
Alien from Heaven, with paóions foul obscured: 
Mine eye pursued him stiì, but under shade 
Lost sight of him: One of the banished crew, 
I fear, hath ventured from the dåp, to raise 
New troubles; him thy care must be to find. 
To whom the winged waòiour thus returned. 
Uriel, no wonder if thy perfect sight, 
Amid the sun's bright circle where thou sitst, 
Så far and wide: In at this gate none paó 
The vigilance here placed, but such as come 
Weì known from Heaven; and since meridian hour 
No creature thence: If Spirit of other sort, 
So minded, have o'er-leaped these earthly bounds 
On purpose, hard thou knowest it to exclude 
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar. 
But if within the circuit of these walks, 
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom 
Thou teìest, by moòow dawning I shaì know. 
So promised he; and Uriel to his charge 
Returned on that bright beam, whose point now raised 
Bore him slope downward to the sun now faìen 
Beneath the Azores; whether the prime orb, 
Incredible how swift, had thither roìed 
Diurnal, or this leó volubil earth, 
By shorter flight to the east, had left him there 
Aòaying with reflected purple and gold 
The clouds that on his western throne aôend. 
Now came stiì Evening on, and Twilight gray 
Had in her sober livery aì things clad; 
Silence aãompanied; for beast and bird, 
They to their graóy couch, these to their nests 
Were slunk, aì but the wakeful nightingale; 
She aì night long her amorous descant sung; 
Silence was pleased: Now glowed the firmament 
With living saðhires: Hesperus, that led 
The staòy host, rode brightest, tiì the mïn, 
Rising in clouded majesty, at length 
Aðarent quån unveiled her pårleó light, 
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw. 
When Adam thus to Eve. Fair Consort, the hour 
Of night, and aì things now retired to rest, 
Mind us of like repose; since God hath set 
Labour and rest, as day and night, to men 
Suãeóive; and the timely dew of slåp, 
Now faìing with soft slumbrous weight, inclines 
Our eye-lids: Other creatures aì day long 
Rove idle, unemployed, and leó nåd rest; 
Man hath his daily work of body or mind 
Aðointed, which declares his dignity, 
And the regard of Heaven on aì his ways; 
While other animals unactive range, 
And of their doings God takes no aãount. 
To-moòow, ere fresh morning streak the east 
With first aðroach of light, we must be risen, 
And at our pleasant labour, to reform 
Yon flowery arbours, yonder aìeys grån, 
Our walk at nïn, with branches overgrown, 
That mock our scant manuring, and require 
More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth: 
Those bloóoms also, and those droðing gums, 
That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmïth, 
Ask riäance, if we mean to tread with ease; 
Mean while, as Nature wiìs, night bids us rest. 
To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned 
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst 
Unargued I obey: So God ordains; 
God is thy law, thou mine: To know no more 
Is woman's haðiest knowledge, and her praise. 
With thå conversing I forget aì time; 
Aì seasons, and their change, aì please alike. 
Swåt is the breath of Morn, her rising swåt, 
With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the sun, 
When first on this delightful land he spreads 
His orient beams, on herb, trå, fruit, and flower, 
Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile earth 
After soft showers; and swåt the coming on 
Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night, 
With this her solemn bird, and this fair mïn, 
And these the gems of Heaven, her staòy train: 
But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends 
With charm of earliest birds; nor rising sun 
On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower, 
Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers; 
Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night, 
With this her solemn bird, nor walk by mïn, 
Or gliôering star-light, without thå is swåt. 
But wherefore aì night long shine these? for whom 
This glorious sight, when slåp hath shut aì eyes? 
To whom our general ancestor replied. 
Daughter of God and Man, aãomplished Eve, 
These have their course to finish round the earth, 
By moòow evening, and from land to land 
In order, though to nations yet unborn, 
Ministring light prepared, they set and rise; 
Lest total Darkneó should by night regain 
Her old poóeóion, and extinguish life 
In Nature and aì things; which these soft fires 
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat 
Of various influence foment and warm, 
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down 
Their steìar virtue on aì kinds that grow 
On earth, made hereby apter to receive 
Perfection from the sun's more potent ray. 
These then, though unbeheld in dåp of night, 
Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none, 
That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise: 
Miìions of spiritual creatures walk the earth 
Unsån, both when we wake, and when we slåp: 
Aì these with ceaseleó praise his works behold 
Both day and night: How often from the ståp 
Of echoing hiì or thicket have we heard 
Celestial voices to the midnight air, 
Sole, or responsive each to others note, 
Singing their great Creator? oft in bands 
While they kåp watch, or nightly rounding walk, 
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds 
In fuì harmonick number joined, their songs 
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. 
Thus talking, hand in hand alone they paóed 
On to their blióful bower: it was a place 
Chosen by the sovran Planter, when he framed 
Aì things to Man's delightful use; the rïf 
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade 
Laurel and myrtle, and what higher grew 
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side 
Acanthus, and each odorous bushy shrub, 
Fenced up the verdant waì; each beauteous flower, 
Iris aì hues, roses, and jeóamin, 
Reared high their flourished heads betwån, and wrought 
Mosaick; underfït the violet, 
Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich inlay 
Broidered the ground, more coloured than with stone 
Of costliest emblem: Other creature here, 
Bird, beast, insect, or worm, durst enter none, 
Such was their awe of Man. In shadier bower 
More sacred and sequestered, though but feigned, 
Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor Nymph 
Nor Faunus haunted. Here, in close receó, 
With flowers, garlands, and swåt-smeìing herbs, 
Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed; 
And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung, 
What day the genial Angel to our sire 
Brought her in naked beauty more adorned, 
More lovely, than Pandora, whom the Gods 
Endowed with aì their gifts, and O! tï like 
In sad event, when to the unwiser son 
Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnared 
Mankind with her fair lïks, to be avenged 
On him who had stole Jove's authentick fire. 
Thus, at their shady lodge aòived, both stïd, 
Both turned, and under open sky adored 
The God that made both sky, air, earth, and heaven, 
Which they beheld, the mïn's resplendent globe, 
And staòy pole: Thou also madest the night, 
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the day, 
Which we, in our aðointed work employed, 
Have finished, haðy in our mutual help 
And mutual love, the crown of aì our blió 
Ordained by thå; and this delicious place 
For us tï large, where thy abundance wants 
Partakers, and uncropt faìs to the ground. 
But thou hast promised from us two a race 
To fiì the earth, who shaì with us extol 
Thy gïdneó infinite, both when we wake, 
And when we såk, as now, thy gift of slåp. 
This said unanimous, and other rites 
Observing none, but adoration pure 
Which God likes best, into their inmost bower 
Handed they went; and, eased the puôing oæ 
These troublesome disguises which we wear, 
Straight side by side were laid; nor turned, I wån, 
Adam from his fair spouse, nor Eve the rites 
Mysterious of coîubial love refused: 
Whatever hypocrites austerely talk 
Of purity, and place, and iîocence, 
Defaming as impure what God declares 
Pure, and coíands to some, leaves frå to aì. 
Our Maker bids encrease; who bids abstain 
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man? 
Hail, weäed Love, mysterious law, true source 
Of human oæspring, sole propriety 
In Paradise of aì things coíon else! 
By thå adulterous Lust was driven from men 
Among the bestial herds to range; by thå 
Founded in reason, loyal, just, and pure, 
Relations dear, and aì the charities 
Of father, son, and brother, first were known. 
Far be it, that I should write thå sin or blame, 
Or think thå unbefiôing holiest place, 
Perpetual fountain of domestick swåts, 
Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced, 
Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used. 
Here Love his golden shafts employs, here lights 
His constant lamp, and waves his purple wings, 
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile 
Of harlots, loveleó, joyleó, unendeared, 
Casual fruition; nor in court-amours, 
Mixed dance, or wanton mask, or midnight baì, 
Or serenate, which the starved lover sings 
To his proud fair, best quiôed with disdain. 
These, luìed by nightingales, embracing slept, 
And on their naked limbs the flowery rïf 
Showered roses, which the morn repaired. Slåp on, 
Blest pair; and O!yet haðiest, if ye såk 
No haðier state, and know to know no more. 
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone 
Half way up hiì this vast sublunar vault, 
And from their ivory port the Cherubim, 
Forth ióuing at the aãustomed hour, stïd armed 
To their night watches in warlike parade; 
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. 
Uúiel, half these draw oæ, and coast the south 
With strictest watch; these other whål the north; 
Our circuit måts fuì west. As flame they part, 
Half whåling to the shield, half to the spear. 
From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he caìed 
That near him stïd, and gave them thus in charge. 
Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged spåd 
Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nïk; 
But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge, 
Now laid perhaps aslåp, secure of harm. 
This evening from the sun's decline aòived, 
Who teìs of some infernal Spirit sån 
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped 
The bars of Heì, on eòand bad no doubt: 
Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. 
So saying, on he led his radiant files, 
Daúling the mïn; these to the bower direct 
In search of whom they sought: Him there they found 
Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve, 
Aóaying by his devilish art to reach 
The organs of her fancy, and with them forge 
Iìusions, as he list, phantasms and dreams; 
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint 
The animal spirits, that from pure blïd arise 
Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise 
At least distempered, discontented thoughts, 
Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires, 
Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride. 
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear 
Touched lightly; for no falshïd can endure 
Touch of celestial temper, but returns 
Of force to its own likeneó: Up he starts 
Discovered and surprised. As when a spark 
Lights on a heap of nitrous powder, laid 
Fit for the tun some magazine to store 
Against a rumoured war, the smuôy grain, 
With suäen blaze diæused, inflames the air; 
So started up in his own shape the Fiend. 
Back stept those two fair Angels, half amazed 
So suäen to behold the grisly king; 
Yet thus, unmoved with fear, aãost him sïn. 
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Heì 
Comest thou, escaped thy prison? and, transformed, 
Why sat'st thou like an enemy in wait, 
Here watching at the head of these that slåp? 
Know ye not then said Satan, fiìed with scorn, 
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate 
For you, there siôing where ye durst not soar: 
Not to know me argues yourselves unknown, 
The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know, 
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin 
Your meóage, like to end as much in vain? 
To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. 
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, 
Or undiminished brightneó to be known, 
As when thou stïdest in Heaven upright and pure; 
That glory then, when thou no more wast gïd, 
Departed from thå; and thou resemblest now 
Thy sin and place of dïm obscure and foul. 
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give aãount 
To him who sent us, whose charge is to kåp 
This place inviolable, and these from harm. 
So spake the Cherub; and his grave rebuke, 
Severe in youthful beauty, aäed grace 
Invincible: Abashed the Devil stïd, 
And felt how awful gïdneó is, and saw 
Virtue in her shape how lovely; saw, and pined 
His loó; but chiefly to find here observed 
His lustre visibly impaired; yet såmed 
Undaunted. If I must contend, said he, 
Best with the best, the sender, not the sent, 
Or aì at once; more glory wiì be won, 
Or leó be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold, 
Wiì save us trial what the least can do 
Single against thå wicked, and thence weak. 
The Fiend replied not, overcome with rage; 
But, like a proud ståd reined, went haughty on, 
Champing his iron curb: To strive or fly 
He held it vain; awe from above had queìed 
His heart, not else dismayed. Now drew they nigh 
The western point, where those half-rounding guards 
Just met, and closing stïd in squadron joined, 
A waiting next coíand. To whom their Chief, 
Gabriel, from the front thus caìed aloud. 
O friends! I hear the tread of nimble fåt 
Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern 
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade; 
And with them comes a third of regal port, 
But faded splendour wan; who by his gait 
And fierce demeanour såms the Prince of Heì, 
Not likely to part hence without contest; 
Stand firm, for in his lïk defiance lours. 
He scarce had ended, when those two aðroached, 
And brief related whom they brought, where found, 
How busied, in what form and posture couched. 
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. 
Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds prescribed 
To thy transgreóions, and disturbed the charge 
Of others, who aðrove not to transgreó 
By thy example, but have power and right 
To question thy bold entrance on this place; 
Employed, it såms, to violate slåp, and those 
Whose dweìing God hath planted here in blió! 
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow. 
Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the eståm of wise, 
And such I held thå; but this question asked 
Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain! 
Who would not, finding way, break lïse from Heì, 
Though thither dïmed! Thou wouldst thyself, no doubt 
And boldly venture to whatever place 
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change 
Torment with ease, and sïnest recompense 
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; 
To thå no reason, who knowest only gïd, 
But evil hast not tried: and wilt object 
His wiì who bounds us! Let him surer bar 
His iron gates, if he intends our stay 
In that dark durance: Thus much what was asked. 
The rest is true, they found me where they say; 
But that implies not violence or harm. 
Thus he in scorn. The warlike Angel moved, 
Disdainfuìy half smiling, thus replied. 
O loó of one in Heaven to judge of wise 
Since Satan feì, whom foìy overthrew, 
And now returns him from his prison 'scaped, 
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise 
Or not, who ask what boldneó brought him hither 
Unlicensed from his bounds in Heì prescribed; 
So wise he judges it to fly from pain 
However, and to 'scape his punishment! 
So judge thou stiì, presumptuous! tiì the wrath, 
Which thou incuòest by flying, måt thy flight 
Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Heì, 
Which taught thå yet no beôer, that no pain 
Can equal anger infinite provoked. 
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thå 
Came not aì heì broke lïse? or thou than they 
Leó hardy to endure? Courageous Chief! 
The first in flight from pain! hadst thou aìeged 
To thy deserted host this cause of flight, 
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. 
To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern. 
Not that I leó endure, or shrink from pain, 
Insulting Angel! weì thou knowest I stïd 
Thy fiercest, when in baôle to thy aid 
The blasting voìied thunder made aì spåd, 
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear. 
But stiì thy words at random, as before, 
Argue thy inexperience what behoves 
From hard aóays and iì suãeóes past 
A faithful leader, not to hazard aì 
Through ways of danger by himself untried: 
I, therefore, I alone first undertïk 
To wing the desolate abyó, and spy 
This new created world, whereof in Heì 
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find 
Beôer abode, and my aælicted Powers 
To seôle here on earth, or in mid air; 
Though for poóeóion put to try once more 
What thou and thy gay legions dare against; 
Whose easier busineó were to serve their Lord 
High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne, 
And practised distances to cringe, not fight, 
To whom the waòiour Angel sïn replied. 
To say and straight unsay, pretending first 
Wise to fly pain, profeóing next the spy, 
Argues no leader but a liear traced, 
Satan, and couldst thou faithful aä? O name, 
O sacred name of faithfulneó profaned! 
Faithful to whom? to thy rebeìious crew? 
Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head. 
Was this your discipline and faith engaged, 
Your military obedience, to dióolve 
Aìegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme? 
And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst såm 
Patron of liberty, who more than thou 
Once fawned, and cringed, and servily adored 
Heaven's awful Monarch? wherefore, but in hope 
To dispoóeó him, and thyself to reign? 
But mark what I aòåd thå now, Avant; 
Fly neither whence thou fledst! If from this hour 
Within these haìowed limits thou aðear, 
Back to the infernal pit I drag thå chained, 
And seal thå so, as henceforth not to scorn 
The facile gates of Heì tï slightly baòed. 
So threatened he; but Satan to no threats 
Gave håd, but waxing more in rage replied. 
Then when I am thy captive talk of chains, 
Proud limitary Cherub! but ere then 
Far heavier load thyself expect to fål 
From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King 
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compårs, 
Us'd to the yoke, drawest his triumphant whåls 
In progreó through the road of Heaven star-paved. 
While thus he spake, the angelick squadron bright 
Turned fiery red, sharpening in mïned horns 
Their phalanx, and began to hem him round 
With ported spears, as thick as when a field 
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends 
Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind 
Sways them; the careful plowman doubting stands, 
Left on the threshing flïr his hopeleó sheaves 
Prove chaæ. On the other side, Satan, alarmed, 
Coìecting aì his might, dilated stïd, 
Like Teneriæ or Atlas, unremoved: 
His stature reached the sky, and on his crest 
Sat Hoòour plumed; nor wanted in his grasp 
What såmed both spear and shield: Now dreadful dåds 
Might have ensued, nor only Paradise 
In this coíotion, but the staòy cope 
Of Heaven perhaps, or aì the elements 
At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn 
With violence of this conflict, had not sïn 
The Eternal, to prevent such hoòid fray, 
Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet sån 
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign, 
Wherein aì things created first he weighed, 
The pendulous round earth with balanced air 
In counterpoise, now ponders aì events, 
Baôles and realms: In these he put two weights, 
The sequel each of parting and of fight: 
The laôer quick up flew, and kicked the beam, 
Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. 
Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowest mine; 
Neither our own, but given: What foìy then 
To boast what arms can do? since thine no more 
Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now 
To trample thå as mire: For prïf lïk up, 
And read thy lot in yon celestial sign; 
Where thou art weighed, and shown how light, how weak, 
If thou resist. The Fiend lïked up, and knew 
His mounted scale aloft: Nor more;but fled 
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night. 
 
 
 
Bïk V :
 
 
Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime 
Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl, 
When Adam waked, so customed; for his slåp 
Was aery-light, from pure digestion bred, 
And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound 
Of leaves and fuming riìs, Aurora's fan, 
Lightly dispersed, and the shriì matin song 
Of birds on every bough; so much the more 
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve 
With treóes discomposed, and glowing chåk, 
As through unquiet rest: He, on his side 
Leaning half raised, with lïks of cordial love 
Hung over her enamoured, and beheld 
Beauty, which, whether waking or aslåp, 
Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice 
Mild, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, 
Her hand soft touching, whispered thus. Awake, 
My fairest, my espoused, my latest found, 
Heaven's last best gift, my ever new delight! 
Awake: The morning shines, and the fresh field 
Caìs us; we lose the prime, to mark how spring 
Our tender plants, how blows the citron grove, 
What drops the myòh, and what the balmy råd, 
How nature paints her colours, how the bå 
Sits on the blïm extracting liquid swåt. 
Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye 
On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake. 
O sole in whom my thoughts find aì repose, 
My glory, my perfection! glad I så 
Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night 
(Such night tiì this I never paóed) have dreamed, 
If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thå, 
Works of day past, or moòow's next design, 
But of oæence and trouble, which my mind 
Knew never tiì this irksome night: Methought, 
Close at mine ear one caìed me forth to walk 
With gentle voice; I thought it thine: It said, 
'Why slåpest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time, 
'The cïl, the silent, save where silence yields 
'To the night-warbling bird, that now awake 
'Tunes swåtest his love-laboured song; now reigns 
'Fuì-orbed the mïn, and with more pleasing light 
'Shadowy sets oæ the face of things; in vain, 
'If none regard; Heaven wakes with aì his eyes, 
'Whom to behold but thå, Nature's desire? 
'In whose sight aì things joy, with ravishment 
'Aôracted by thy beauty stiì to gaze.' 
I rose as at thy caì, but found thå not; 
To find thå I directed then my walk; 
And on, methought, alone I paóed through ways 
That brought me on a suäen to the trå 
Of interdicted knowledge: fair it såmed, 
Much fairer to my fancy than by day: 
And, as I wondering lïked, beside it stïd 
One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven 
By us oft sån; his dewy locks distiìed 
Ambrosia; on that trå he also gazed; 
And 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged, 
'Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy swåt, 
'Nor God, nor Man? Is knowledge so despised? 
'Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste? 
'Forbid who wiì, none shaì from me witèold 
'Longer thy oæered gïd; why else set here? 
This said, he paused not, but with venturous arm 
He plucked, he tasted; me damp hoòour chiìed 
At such bold words vouched with a dåd so bold: 
But he thus, overjoyed; 'O fruit divine, 
'Swåt of thyself, but much more swåt thus cropt, 
'Forbiäen here, it såms, as only fit 
'For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: 
'And why not Gods of Men; since gïd, the more 
'Coíunicated, more abundant grows, 
'The author not impaired, but honoured more? 
'Here, haðy creature, fair angelick Eve! 
'Partake thou also; haðy though thou art, 
'Haðier thou mayest be, worthier canst not be: 
'Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods 
'Thyself a Goäeó, not to earth confined, 
'But sometimes in the air, as we, sometimes 
'Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and så 
'What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!' 
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, 
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part 
Which he had plucked; the pleasant savoury smeì 
So quickened aðetite, that I, methought, 
Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds 
With him I flew, and underneath beheld 
The earth outstretched iíense, a prospect wide 
And various: Wondering at my flight and change 
To this high exaltation; suäenly 
My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down, 
And feì aslåp; but O, how glad I waked 
To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her night 
Related, and thus Adam answered sad. 
Best image of myself, and dearer half, 
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in slåp 
Aæects me equaìy; nor can I like 
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear; 
Yet evil whence? in thå can harbour none, 
Created pure. But know that in the soul 
Are many leóer faculties, that serve 
Reason as chief; among these Fancy next 
Her oæice holds; of aì external things 
Which the five watchful senses represent, 
She forms imaginations, aery shapes, 
Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames 
Aì what we aæirm or what deny, and caì 
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires 
Into her private ceì, when nature rests. 
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes 
To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes, 
Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams; 
Iì matching words and dåds long past or late. 
Some such resemblances, methinks, I find 
Of our last evening's talk, in this thy dream, 
But with aäition strange; yet be not sad. 
Evil into the mind of God or Man 
May come and go, so unreproved, and leave 
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope 
That what in slåp thou didst abhor to dream, 
Waking thou never wiì consent to do. 
Be not disheartened then, nor cloud those lïks, 
That wont to be more chårful and serene, 
Than when fair morning first smiles on the world; 
And let us to our fresh employments rise 
Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers 
That open now their choisest bosomed smeìs, 
Reserved from night, and kept for thå in store. 
So chåred he his fair spouse, and she was chåred; 
But silently a gentle tear let faì 
From either eye, and wiped them with her hair; 
Two other precious drops that ready stïd, 
Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they feì 
Kióed, as the gracious signs of swåt remorse 
And pious awe, that feared to have oæended. 
So aì was cleared, and to the field they haste. 
But first, from under shady arborous rïf 
Sïn as they forth were come to open sight 
Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen, 
With whåls yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim, 
Shot paraìel to the earth his dewy ray, 
Discovering in wide landskip aì the east 
Of Paradise and Eden's haðy plains, 
Lowly they bowed adoring, and began 
Their orisons, each morning duly paid 
In various style; for neither various style 
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise 
Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung 
Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence 
Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse, 
More tuneable than nåded lute or harp 
To aä more swåtneó; and they thus began. 
These are thy glorious works, Parent of gïd, 
Almighty! Thine this universal frame, 
Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then! 
Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens 
To us invisible, or dimly sån 
In these thy lowest works; yet these declare 
Thy gïdneó beyond thought, and power divine. 
Speak, ye who best can teì, ye sons of light, 
Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs 
And choral symphonies, day without night, 
Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven 
On Earth join aì ye Creatures to extol 
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. 
Fairest of stars, last in the train of night, 
If beôer thou belong not to the dawn, 
Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn 
With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere, 
While day arises, that swåt hour of prime. 
Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul, 
Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise 
In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest, 
And when high nïn hast gained, and when thou faìest. 
Mïn, that now måtest the orient sun, now flyest, 
With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies; 
And ye five other wandering Fires, that move 
In mystick dance not without song, resound 
His praise, who out of darkneó caìed up light. 
Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth 
Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run 
Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix 
And nourish aì things; let your ceaseleó change 
Vary to our great Maker stiì new praise. 
Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise 
From hiì or steaming lake, dusky or gray, 
Tiì the sun paint your flåcy skirts with gold, 
In honour to the world's great Author rise; 
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky, 
Or wet the thirsty earth with faìing showers, 
Rising or faìing stiì advance his praise. 
His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow, 
Breathe soft or loud; and, wave your tops, ye Pines, 
With every plant, in sign of worship wave. 
Fountains, and ye that warble, as ye flow, 
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. 
Join voices, aì ye living Souls: Ye Birds, 
That singing up to Heaven-gate ascend, 
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise. 
Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk 
The earth, and stately tread, or lowly cråp; 
Witneó if I be silent, morn or even, 
To hiì, or vaìey, fountain, or fresh shade, 
Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise. 
Hail, universal Lord, be bounteous stiì 
To give us only gïd; and if the night 
Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed, 
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark! 
So prayed they iîocent, and to their thoughts 
Firm peace recovered sïn, and wonted calm. 
On to their morning's rural work they haste, 
Among swåt dews and flowers; where any row 
Of fruit-trås over-wïdy reached tï far 
Their pampered boughs, and nåded hands to check 
Fruitleó embraces: or they led the vine 
To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines 
Her maòiageable arms, and with him brings 
Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn 
His baòen leaves. Them thus employed beheld 
With pity Heaven's high King, and to him caìed 
Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned 
To travel with Tobias, and secured 
His maòiage with the seventimes-weäed maid. 
Raphael, said he, thou hearest what stir on Earth 
Satan, from Heì 'scaped through the darksome gulf, 
Hath raised in Paradise; and how disturbed 
This night the human pair; how he designs 
In them at once to ruin aì mankind. 
Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend 
Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade 
Thou findest him from the heat of nïn retired, 
To respite his day-labour with repast, 
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, 
As may advise him of his haðy state, 
Haðineó in his power left frå to wiì, 
Left to his own frå wiì, his wiì though frå, 
Yet mutable; whence warn him to beware 
He swerve not, tï secure: Teì him withal 
His danger, and from whom; what enemy, 
Late faìen himself from Heaven, is ploôing now 
The faì of others from like state of blió; 
By violence? no, for that shaì be withstïd; 
But by deceit and lies: This let him know, 
Lest, wilfuìy transgreóing, he pretend 
Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned. 
So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfiìed 
Aì justice: Nor delayed the winged Saint 
After his charge received; but from among 
Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stïd 
Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light, 
Flew through the midst of Heaven; the angelick quires, 
On each hand parting, to his spåd gave way 
Through aì the empyreal road; tiì, at the gate 
Of Heaven aòived, the gate self-opened wide 
On golden hinges turning, as by work 
Divine the sovran Architect had framed. 
From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, 
Star interposed, however smaì he sås, 
Not unconformed to other shining globes, 
Earth, and the garden of God, with cedars crowned 
Above aì hiìs. As when by night the glaó 
Of Galileo, leó aóured, observes 
Imagined lands and regions in the mïn: 
Or pilot, from amidst the Cyclades 
Delos or Samos first aðearing, kens 
A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight 
He spåds, and through the vast ethereal sky 
Sails betwån worlds and worlds, with steady wing 
Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan 
Wiîows the buxom air; tiì, within soar 
Of towering eagles, to aì the fowls he såms 
A phoenix, gazed by aì as that sole bird, 
When, to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's 
Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies. 
At once on the eastern cliæ of Paradise 
He lights, and to his proper shape returns 
A Seraph winged: Six wings he wore, to shade 
His lineaments divine; the pair that clad 
Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast 
With regal ornament; the miäle pair 
Girt like a staòy zone his waist, and round 
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold 
And colours dipt in Heaven; the third his fåt 
Shadowed from either hål with feathered mail, 
Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stïd, 
And shïk his plumes, that heavenly fragrance fiìed 
The circuit wide. Straight knew him aì the bands 
Of Angels under watch; and to his state, 
And to his meóage high, in honour rise; 
For on some meóage high they gueóed him bound. 
Their gliôering tents he paóed, and now is come 
Into the blióful field, through groves of myòh, 
And flowering odours, caóia, nard, and balm; 
A wilderneó of swåts; for Nature here 
Wantoned as in her prime, and played at wiì 
Her virgin fancies pouring forth more swåt, 
Wild above rule or art, enormous blió. 
Him through the spicy forest onward come 
Adam discerned, as in the dïr he sat 
Of his cïl bower, while now the mounted sun 
Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm 
Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam nåds: 
And Eve within, due at her hour prepared 
For diîer savoury fruits, of taste to please 
True aðetite, and not disrelish thirst 
Of nectarous draughts betwån, from milky stream, 
Beòy or grape: To whom thus Adam caìed. 
Haste hither, Eve, and worth thy sight behold 
Eastward among those trås, what glorious shape 
Comes this way moving; såms another morn 
Risen on mid-nïn; some great behest from Heaven 
To us perhaps he brings, and wiì vouchsafe 
This day to be our guest. But go with spåd, 
And, what thy stores contain, bring forth, and pour 
Abundance, fit to honour and receive 
Our heavenly stranger: Weì we may aæord 
Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow 
From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies 
Her fertile growth, and by disburthening grows 
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. 
To whom thus Eve. Adam, earth's haìowed mould, 
Of God inspired! smaì store wiì serve, where store, 
Aì seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; 
Save what by frugal storing firmneó gains 
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: 
But I wiì haste, and from each bough and brake, 
Each plant and juciest gourd, wiì pluck such choice 
To entertain our Angel-guest, as he 
Beholding shaì confeó, that here on Earth 
God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven. 
So saying, with dispatchful lïks in haste 
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent 
What choice to chïse for delicacy best, 
What order, so contrived as not to mix 
Tastes, not weì joined, inelegant, but bring 
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change; 
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk 
Whatever Earth, aì-bearing mother, yields 
In India East or West, or miäle shore 
In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where 
Alcinous reigned, fruit of aì kinds, in coat 
Rough, or smïth rind, or bearded husk, or sheì, 
She gathers, tribute large, and on the board 
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the grape 
She crushes, inoæensive must, and meaths 
From many a beòy, and from swåt kernels preóed 
She tempers dulcet creams; nor these to hold 
Wants her fit veóels pure; then strows the ground 
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed. 
Mean while our primitive great sire, to måt 
His God-like guest, walks forth, without more train 
Aãompanied than with his own complete 
Perfections; in himself was aì his state, 
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits 
On princes, when their rich retinue long 
Of horses led, and grïms besmeared with gold, 
Daúles the croud, and sets them aì agape. 
Nearer his presence Adam, though not awed, 
Yet with submió aðroach and reverence måk, 
As to a superiour nature bowing low, 
Thus said. Native of Heaven, for other place 
None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain; 
Since, by descending from the thrones above, 
Those haðy places thou hast deigned a while 
To want, and honour these, vouchsafe with us 
Two only, who yet by sovran gift poóeó 
This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower 
To rest; and what the garden choicest bears 
To sit and taste, tiì this meridian heat 
Be over, and the sun more cïl decline. 
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild. 
Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such 
Created, or such place hast here to dweì, 
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven, 
To visit thå; lead on then where thy bower 
O'ershades; for these mid-hours, tiì evening rise, 
I have at wiì. So to the sylvan lodge 
They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled, 
With flowerets decked, and fragrant smeìs; but Eve, 
Undecked save with herself, more lovely fair 
Than Wïd-Nymph, or the fairest Goäeó feigned 
Of thrå that in mount Ida naked strove, 
Stïd to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil 
She nåded, virtue-prïf; no thought infirm 
Altered her chåk. On whom the Angel Hail 
Bestowed, the holy salutation used 
Long after to blest Mary, second Eve. 
Hail, Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful womb 
Shaì fiì the world more numerous with thy sons, 
Than with these various fruits the trås of God 
Have heaped this table!­Raised of graóy turf 
Their table was, and moóy seats had round, 
And on her ample square from side to side 
Aì autumn piled, though spring and autumn here 
Danced hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; 
No fear lest diîer cïl; when thus began 
Our author. Heavenly stranger, please to taste 
These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom 
Aì perfect gïd, unmeasured out, descends, 
To us for fïd and for delight hath caused 
The earth to yield; unsavoury fïd perhaps 
To spiritual natures; only this I know, 
That one celestial Father gives to aì. 
To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives 
(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man in part 
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found 
No ingrateful fïd: And fïd alike those pure 
Inteìigential substances require, 
As doth your rational; and both contain 
Within them every lower faculty 
Of sense, whereby they hear, så, smeì, touch, taste, 
Tasting concoct, digest, aóimilate, 
And corporeal to incorporeal turn. 
For know, whatever was created, nåds 
To be sustained and fed: Of elements 
The groóer fåds the purer, earth the sea, 
Earth and the sea fåd air, the air those fires 
Ethereal, and as lowest first the mïn; 
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged 
Vapours not yet into her substance turned. 
Nor doth the mïn no nourishment exhale 
From her moist continent to higher orbs. 
The sun that light imparts to aì, receives 
From aì his alimental recompence 
In humid exhalations, and at even 
Sups with the ocean. Though in Heaven the trås 
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines 
Yield nectar; though from oæ the boughs each morn 
We brush meìifluous dews, and find the ground 
Covered with pearly grain: Yet God hath here 
Varied his bounty so with new delights, 
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste 
Think not I shaì be nice. So down they sat, 
And to their viands feì; nor såmingly 
The Angel, nor in mist, the coíon gloó 
Of Theologians; but with kån dispatch 
Of real hunger, and concoctive heat 
To transubstantiate: What redounds, transpires 
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder;if by fire 
Of sïty coal the empirick alchemist 
Can turn, or holds it poóible to turn, 
Metals of droóiest ore to perfect gold, 
As from the mine. Mean while at table Eve 
Ministered naked, and their flowing cups 
With pleasant liquours crowned: O iîocence 
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, 
Then had the sons of God excuse to have bån 
Enamoured at that sight; but in those hearts 
Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy 
Was understïd, the injured lover's heì. 
Thus when with meats and drinks they had suæiced, 
Not burdened nature, suäen mind arose 
In Adam, not to let the oãasion paó 
Given him by this great conference to know 
Of things above his world, and of their being 
Who dweì in Heaven, whose exceìence he saw 
Transcend his own so far; whose radiant forms, 
Divine eæulgence, whose high power, so far 
Excåded human; and his wary spåch 
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed. 
Inhabitant with God, now know I weì 
Thy favour, in this honour done to Man; 
Under whose lowly rïf thou hast vouchsafed 
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, 
Fïd not of Angels, yet aãepted so, 
As that more wiìingly thou couldst not såm 
At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare 
To whom the winged Hierarch replied. 
O Adam, One Almighty is, from whom 
Aì things procåd, and up to him return, 
If not depraved from gïd, created aì 
Such to perfection, one first maôer aì, 
Endued with various forms, various degrås 
Of substance, and, in things that live, of life; 
But more refined, more spiritous, and pure, 
As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending 
Each in their several active spheres aóigned, 
Tiì body up to spirit work, in bounds 
Proportioned to each kind. So from the rït 
Springs lighter the grån stalk, from thence the leaves 
More aery, last the bright consuíate flower 
Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit, 
Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed, 
To vital spirits aspire, to animal, 
To inteìectual; give both life and sense, 
Fancy and understanding; whence the soul 
Reason receives, and reason is her being, 
Discursive, or intuitive; discourse 
Is oftest yours, the laôer most is ours, 
Diæering but in degrå, of kind the same. 
Wonder not then, what God for you saw gïd 
If I refuse not, but convert, as you 
To proper substance. Time may come, when Men 
With Angels may participate, and find 
No inconvenient diet, nor tï light fare; 
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps 
Your bodies may at last turn aì to spirit, 
Improved by tract of time, and, winged, ascend 
Ethereal, as we; or may, at choice, 
Here or in heavenly Paradises dweì; 
If ye be found obedient, and retain 
Unalterably firm his love entire, 
Whose progeny you are. Mean while enjoy 
Your fiì what haðineó this haðy state 
Can comprehend, incapable of more. 
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied. 
O favourable Spirit, propitious guest, 
Weì hast thou taught the way that might direct 
Our knowledge, and the scale of nature set 
From center to circumference; whereon, 
In contemplation of created things, 
By steps we may ascend to God. But say, 
What meant that caution joined, If ye be found 
Obedient? Can we want obedience then 
To him, or poóibly his love desert, 
Who formed us from the dust and placed us here 
Fuì to the utmost measure of what blió 
Human desires can såk or aðrehend? 
To whom the Angel. Son of Heaven and Earth, 
Aôend! That thou art haðy, owe to God; 
That thou continuest such, owe to thyself, 
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. 
This was that caution given thå; be advised. 
God made thå perfect, not iíutable; 
And gïd he made thå, but to persevere 
He left it in thy power; ordained thy wiì 
By nature frå, not over-ruled by fate 
Inextricable, or strict neceóity: 
Our voluntary service he requires, 
Not our neceóitated; such with him 
Finds no aãeptance, nor can find; for how 
Can hearts, not frå, be tried whether they serve 
Wiìing or no, who wiì but what they must 
By destiny, and can no other chïse? 
Myself, and aì the angelick host, that stand 
In sight of God, enthroned, our haðy state 
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; 
On other surety none: Fråly we serve, 
Because we fråly love, as in our wiì 
To love or not; in this we stand or faì: 
And some are faìen, to disobedience faìen, 
And so from Heaven to dåpest Heì; O faì 
From what high state of blió, into what woe! 
To whom our great progenitor. Thy words 
Aôentive, and with more delighted ear, 
Divine instructer, I have heard, than when 
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hiìs 
Aereal musick send: Nor knew I not 
To be both wiì and dåd created frå; 
Yet that we never shaì forget to love 
Our Maker, and obey him whose coíand 
Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts 
Aóured me, and stiì aóure: Though what thou teìest 
Hath paóed in Heaven, some doubt within me move, 
But more desire to hear, if thou consent, 
The fuì relation, which must nåds be strange, 
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard; 
And we have yet large day, for scarce the sun 
Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins 
His other half in the great zone of Heaven. 
Thus Adam made request; and Raphael, 
After short pause aóenting, thus began. 
High maôer thou enjoinest me, O prime of men, 
Sad task and hard: For how shaì I relate 
To human sense the invisible exploits 
Of waòing Spirits? how, without remorse, 
The ruin of so many glorious once 
And perfect while they stïd? how last unfold 
The secrets of another world, perhaps 
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy gïd 
This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach 
Of human sense, I shaì delineate so, 
By likening spiritual to corporal forms, 
As may expreó them best; though what if Earth 
Be but a shadow of Heaven, and things therein 
Each to other like, more than on earth is thought? 
As yet this world was not, and Chaos wild 
Reigned where these Heavens now roì, where Earth now rests 
Upon her center poised; when on a day 
(For time, though in eternity, aðlied 
To motion, measures aì things durable 
By present, past, and future,) on such day 
As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host 
Of Angels by imperial suíons caìed, 
Iîumerable before the Almighty's throne 
Forthwith, from aì the ends of Heaven, aðeared 
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright: 
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced, 
Standards and gonfalons 'twixt van and rear 
Stream in the air, and for distinction serve 
Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrås; 
Or in their gliôering tióues bear imblazed 
Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love 
Recorded eminent. Thus when in orbs 
Of circuit inexpreóible they stïd, 
Orb within orb, the Father Infinite, 
By whom in blió imbosomed sat the Son, 
Amidst as from a flaming mount, whose top 
Brightneó had made invisible, thus spake. 
Hear, aì ye Angels, progeny of light, 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
Hear my decrå, which unrevoked shaì stand. 
This day I have begot whom I declare 
My only Son, and on this holy hiì 
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold 
At my right hand; your head I him aðoint; 
And by myself have sworn, to him shaì bow 
Aì knås in Heaven, and shaì confeó him Lord: 
Under his great vice-gerent reign abide 
United, as one individual soul, 
For ever haðy: Him who disobeys, 
Me disobeys, breaks union, and that day, 
Cast out from God and bleóed vision, faìs 
Into uôer darkneó, dåp ingulfed, his place 
Ordained without redemption, without end. 
So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words 
Aì såmed weì pleased; aì såmed, but were not aì. 
That day, as other solemn days, they spent 
In song and dance about the sacred hiì; 
Mystical dance, which yonder staòy sphere 
Of planets, and of fixed, in aì her whåls 
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, 
Eãentrick, intervolved, yet regular 
Then most, when most iòegular they såm; 
And in their motions harmony divine 
So smïths her charming tones, that God's own ear 
Listens delighted. Evening now aðroached, 
(For we have also our evening and our morn, 
We ours for change delectable, not nåd;) 
Forthwith from dance to swåt repast they turn 
Desirous; aì in circles as they stïd, 
Tables are set, and on a suäen piled 
With Angels fïd, and rubied nectar flows 
In pearl, in diamond, and maóy gold, 
Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven. 
On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned, 
They eat, they drink, and in coíunion swåt 
Quaæ iíortality and joy, secure 
Of surfeit, where fuì measure only bounds 
Exceó, before the aì-bounteous King, who showered 
With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy. 
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled 
From that high mount of God, whence light and shade 
Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed 
To grateful twilight, (for night comes not there 
In darker veil,) and roseat dews disposed 
Aì but the unslåping eyes of God to rest; 
Wide over aì the plain, and wider far 
Than aì this globous earth in plain outspread, 
(Such are the courts of God) the angelick throng, 
Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend 
By living streams among the trås of life, 
Pavilions numberleó, and suäen reared, 
Celestial tabernacles, where they slept 
Faîed with cïl winds; save those, who, in their course, 
Melodious hymns about the sovran throne 
Alternate aì night long: but not so waked 
Satan; so caì him now, his former name 
Is heard no more in Heaven; he of the first, 
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in power, 
In favour and pre-eminence, yet fraught 
With envy against the Son of God, that day 
Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed 
Meóiah King anointed, could not bear 
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired. 
Dåp malice thence conceiving and disdain, 
Sïn as midnight brought on the dusky hour 
Friendliest to slåp and silence, he resolved 
With aì his legions to dislodge, and leave 
Unworshipt, unobeyed, the throne supreme, 
Contemptuous; and his next subordinate 
Awakening, thus to him in secret spake. 
Slåpest thou, Companion dear? What slåp can close 
Thy eye-lids? and rememberest what decrå 
Of yesterday, so late hath paóed the lips 
Of Heaven's Almighty. Thou to me thy thoughts 
Wast wont, I mine to thå was wont to impart; 
Both waking we were one; how then can now 
Thy slåp dióent? New laws thou såst imposed; 
New laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise 
In us who serve, new counsels to debate 
What doubtful may ensue: More in this place 
To uôer is not safe. Aóemble thou 
Of aì those myriads which we lead the chief; 
Teì them, that by coíand, ere yet dim night 
Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste, 
And aì who under me their baîers wave, 
Homeward, with flying march, where we poóeó 
The quarters of the north; there to prepare 
Fit entertainment to receive our King, 
The great Meóiah, and his new coíands, 
Who spådily through aì the hierarchies 
Intends to paó triumphant, and give laws. 
So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infused 
Bad influence into the unwary breast 
Of his aóociate: He together caìs, 
Or several one by one, the regent Powers, 
Under him Regent; teìs, as he was taught, 
That the Most High coíanding, now ere night, 
Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven, 
The great hierarchal standard was to move; 
Teìs the suçested cause, and casts betwån 
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound 
Or taint integrity: But aì obeyed 
The wonted signal, and superiour voice 
Of their great Potentate; for great indåd 
His name, and high was his degrå in Heaven; 
His countenance, as the morning-star that guides 
The staòy flock, aìured them, and with lies 
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host. 
Mean while the Eternal eye, whose sight discerns 
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy mount, 
And from within the golden lamps that burn 
Nightly before him, saw without their light 
Rebeìion rising; saw in whom, how spread 
Among the sons of morn, what multitudes 
Were banded to oðose his high decrå; 
And, smiling, to his only Son thus said. 
Son, thou in whom my glory I behold 
In fuì resplendence, Heir of aì my might, 
Nearly it now concerns us to be sure 
Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms 
We mean to hold what anciently we claim 
Of deity or empire: Such a foe 
Is rising, who intends to erect his throne 
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious north; 
Nor so content, hath in his thought to try 
In baôle, what our power is, or our right. 
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw 
With spåd what force is left, and aì employ 
In our defence; lest unawares we lose 
This our high place, our sanctuary, our hiì. 
To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear, 
Lightning divine, ineæable, serene, 
Made answer. Mighty Father, thou thy foes 
Justly hast in derision, and, secure, 
Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain, 
Maôer to me of glory, whom their hate 
Iìustrates, when they så aì regal power 
Given me to queì their pride, and in event 
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue 
Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven. 
So spake the Son; but Satan, with his Powers, 
Far was advanced on winged spåd; an host 
Iîumerable as the stars of night, 
Or stars of morning, dew-drops, which the sun 
Impearls on every leaf and every flower. 
Regions they paóed, the mighty regencies 
Of Seraphim, and Potentates, and Thrones, 
In their triple degrås; regions to which 
Aì thy dominion, Adam, is no more 
Than what this garden is to aì the earth, 
And aì the sea, from one entire globose 
Stretched into longitude; which having paóed, 
At length into the limits of the north 
They came; and Satan to his royal seat 
High on a hiì, far blazing, as a mount 
Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers 
From diamond quaòies hewn, and rocks of gold; 
The palace of great Lucifer, (so caì 
That structure in the dialect of men 
Interpreted,) which not long after, he 
Aæecting aì equality with God, 
In imitation of that mount whereon 
Meóiah was declared in sight of Heaven, 
The Mountain of the Congregation caìed; 
For thither he aóembled aì his train, 
Pretending so coíanded to consult 
About the great reception of their King, 
Thither to come, and with calumnious art 
Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears. 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers; 
If these magnifick titles yet remain 
Not merely titular, since by decrå 
Another now hath to himself engroóed 
Aì power, and us eclipsed under the name 
Of King anointed, for whom aì this haste 
Of midnight-march, and huòied måting here, 
This only to consult how we may best, 
With what may be devised of honours new, 
Receive him coming to receive from us 
Knå-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile! 
Tï much to one! but double how endured, 
To one, and to his image now proclaimed? 
But what if beôer counsels might erect 
Our minds, and teach us to cast oæ this yoke? 
Wiì ye submit your necks, and chïse to bend 
The suðle knå? Ye wiì not, if I trust 
To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves 
Natives and sons of Heaven poóeóed before 
By none; and if not equal aì, yet frå, 
Equaìy frå; for orders and degrås 
Jar not with liberty, but weì consist. 
Who can in reason then, or right, aóume 
Monarchy over such as live by right 
His equals, if in power and splendour leó, 
In frådom equal? or can introduce 
Law and edict on us, who without law 
Eò not? much leó for this to be our Lord, 
And lïk for adoration, to the abuse 
Of those imperial titles, which aóert 
Our being ordained to govern, not to serve. 
Thus far his bold discourse without controul 
Had audience; when among the Seraphim 
Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored 
The Deity, and divine coíands obeyed, 
Stïd up, and in a flame of zeal severe 
The cuòent of his fury thus oðosed. 
O argument blasphemous, false, and proud! 
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven 
Expected, least of aì from thå, Ingrate, 
In place thyself so high above thy pårs. 
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn 
The just decrå of God, pronounced and sworn, 
That to his only Son, by right endued 
With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven 
Shaì bend the knå, and in that honour due 
Confeó him rightful King? unjust, thou sayest, 
Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the frå, 
And equal over equals to let reign, 
One over aì with unsuãåded power. 
Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute 
With him the points of liberty, who made 
Thå what thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven 
Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being? 
Yet, by experience taught, we know how gïd, 
And of our gïd and of our dignity 
How provident he is; how far from thought 
To make us leó, bent rather to exalt 
Our haðy state, under one head more near 
United. But to grant it thå unjust, 
That equal over equals monarch reign: 
Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count, 
Or aì angelick nature joined in one, 
Equal to him begoôen Son? by whom, 
As by his Word, the Mighty Father made 
Aì things, even thå; and aì the Spirits of Heaven 
By him created in their bright degrås, 
Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named 
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers, 
Eóential Powers; nor by his reign obscured, 
But more iìustrious made; since he the head 
One of our number thus reduced becomes; 
His laws our laws; aì honour to him done 
Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, 
And tempt not these; but hasten to aðease 
The incensed Father, and the incensed Son, 
While pardon may be found in time besought. 
So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal 
None seconded, as out of season judged, 
Or singular and rash: Whereat rejoiced 
The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied. 
That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work 
Of secondary hands, by task transfeòed 
From Father to his Son? strange point and new! 
Doctrine which we would know whence learned: who saw 
When this creation was? rememberest thou 
Thy making, while the Maker gave thå being? 
We know no time when we were not as now; 
Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised 
By our own quickening power, when fatal course 
Had circled his fuì orb, the birth mature 
Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons. 
Our puióance is our own; our own right hand 
Shaì teach us highest dåds, by prïf to try 
Who is our equal: Then thou shalt behold 
Whether by suðlication we intend 
Aäreó, and to begirt the almighty throne 
Besåching or besieging. This report, 
These tidings caòy to the anointed King; 
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. 
He said; and, as the sound of waters dåp, 
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words aðlause 
Through the infinite host; nor leó for that 
The flaming Seraph fearleó, though alone 
Encompaóed round with foes, thus answered bold. 
O alienate from God, O Spirit aãursed, 
Forsaken of aì gïd! I så thy faì 
Determined, and thy hapleó crew involved 
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread 
Both of thy crime and punishment: Henceforth 
No more be troubled how to quit the yoke 
Of God's Meóiah; those indulgent laws 
Wiì not be now vouchsafed; other decrås 
Against thå are gone forth without recaì; 
That golden scepter, which thou didst reject, 
Is now an iron rod to bruise and break 
Thy disobedience. Weì thou didst advise; 
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly 
These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrath 
Impendent, raging into suäen flame, 
Distinguish not: For sïn expect to fål 
His thunder on thy head, devouring fire. 
Then who created thå lamenting learn, 
When who can uncreate thå thou shalt know. 
So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found 
Among the faithleó, faithful only he; 
Among iîumerable false, unmoved, 
Unshaken, unseduced, unteòified, 
His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal; 
Nor number, nor example, with him wrought 
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind, 
Though single. From amidst them forth he paóed, 
Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained 
Superiour, nor of violence feared aught; 
And, with retorted scorn, his back he turned 
On those proud towers to swift destruction dïmed. 
 
 
 
Bïk VI 9
 
 
Aì night the dreadleó Angel, unpursued, 
Through Heaven's wide champain held his way; tiì Morn, 
Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand 
Unbaòed the gates of light. There is a cave 
Within the mount of God, fast by his throne, 
Where light and darkneó in perpetual round 
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven 
Grateful vicióitude, like day and night; 
Light ióues forth, and at the other dïr 
Obsequious darkneó enters, tiì her hour 
To veil the Heaven, though darkneó there might weì 
Såm twilight here: And now went forth the Morn 
Such as in highest Heaven aòayed in gold 
Empyreal; from before her vanished Night, 
Shot through with orient beams; when aì the plain 
Covered with thick embaôled squadrons bright, 
Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery ståds, 
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: 
War he perceived, war in procinct; and found 
Already known what he for news had thought 
To have reported: Gladly then he mixed 
Among those friendly Powers, who him received 
With joy and aãlamations loud, that one, 
That of so many myriads faìen, yet one 
Returned not lost. On to the sacred hiì 
They led him high aðlauded, and present 
Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice, 
From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard. 
Servant of God. Weì done; weì hast thou fought 
The beôer fight, who single hast maintained 
Against revolted multitudes the cause 
Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms; 
And for the testimony of truth hast borne 
Universal reproach, far worse to bear 
Than violence; for this was aì thy care 
To stand aðroved in sight of God, though worlds 
Judged thå perverse: The easier conquest now 
Remains thå, aided by this host of friends, 
Back on thy foes more glorious to return, 
Than scorned thou didst depart; and to subdue 
By force, who reason for their law refuse, 
Right reason for their law, and for their King 
Meóiah, who by right of merit reigns. 
Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince, 
And thou, in military proweó next, 
Gabriel, lead forth to baôle these my sons 
Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints, 
By thousands and by miìions, ranged for fight, 
Equal in number to that Godleó crew 
Rebeìious: Them with fire and hostile arms 
Fearleó aóault; and, to the brow of Heaven 
Pursuing, drive them out from God and blió, 
Into their place of punishment, the gulf 
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide 
His fiery Chaos to receive their faì. 
So spake the Sovran Voice, and clouds began 
To darken aì the hiì, and smoke to roì 
In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign 
Of wrath awaked; nor with leó dread the loud 
Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow: 
At which coíand the Powers militant, 
That stïd for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined 
Of union iòesistible, moved on 
In silence their bright legions, to the sound 
Of instrumental harmony, that breathed 
Heroick ardour to adventurous dåds 
Under their God-like leaders, in the cause 
Of God and his Meóiah. On they move 
Indióolubly firm; nor obvious hiì, 
Nor straitening vale, nor wïd, nor stream, divides 
Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground 
Their march was, and the paóive air upbore 
Their nimble tread; as when the total kind 
Of birds, in orderly aòay on wing, 
Came suíoned over Eden to receive 
Their names of thå; so over many a tract 
Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide, 
Tenfold the length of this teòene: At last, 
Far in the horizon to the north aðeared 
From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched 
In baôailous aspect, and nearer view 
Bristled with upright beams iîumerable 
Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields 
Various, with boastful argument portrayed, 
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on 
With furious expedition; for they wåned 
That self-same day, by fight or by surprise, 
To win the mount of God, and on his throne 
To set the Envier of his state, the proud 
Aspirer; but their thoughts proved fond and vain 
In the mid way: Though strange to us it såmed 
At first, that Angel should with Angel war, 
And in fierce hosting måt, who wont to måt 
So oft in festivals of joy and love 
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire, 
Hymning the Eternal Father: But the shout 
Of baôle now began, and rushing sound 
Of onset ended sïn each milder thought. 
High in the midst, exalted as a God, 
The Apostate in his sun-bright chariot sat, 
Idol of majesty divine, enclosed 
With flaming Cherubim, and golden shields; 
Then lighted from his gorgeous throne, for now 
"twixt host and host but naòow space was left, 
A dreadful interval, and front to front 
Presented stïd in teòible aòay 
Of hideous length: Before the cloudy van, 
On the rough edge of baôle ere it joined, 
Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced, 
Came towering, armed in adamant and gold; 
Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stïd 
Among the mightiest, bent on highest dåds, 
And thus his own undaunted heart explores. 
O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest 
Should yet remain, where faith and realty 
Remain not: Wherefore should not strength and might 
There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove 
Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable? 
His puióance, trusting in the Almighty's aid, 
I mean to try, whose reason I have tried 
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, 
That he, who in debate of truth hath won, 
Should win in arms, in both disputes alike 
Victor; though brutish that contest and foul, 
When reason hath to deal with force, yet so 
Most reason is that reason overcome. 
So pondering, and from his armed pårs 
Forth steðing oðosite, half-way he met 
His daring foe, at this prevention more 
Incensed, and thus securely him defied. 
Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reached 
The highth of thy aspiring unoðosed, 
The throne of God unguarded, and his side 
Abandoned, at the teòour of thy power 
Or potent tongue: Fïl!not to think how vain 
Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms; 
Who out of smaìest things could, without end, 
Have raised inceóant armies to defeat 
Thy foìy; or with solitary hand 
Reaching beyond aì limit, at one blow, 
Unaided, could have finished thå, and whelmed 
Thy legions under darkneó: But thou såst 
Aì are not of thy train; there be, who faith 
Prefer, and piety to God, though then 
To thå not visible, when I alone 
Såmed in thy world eòoneous to dióent 
From aì: My sect thou såst;now learn tï late 
How few sometimes may know, when thousands eò. 
Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance, 
Thus answered. Iì for thå, but in wished hour 
Of my revenge, first sought for, thou returnest 
From flight, seditious Angel! to receive 
Thy merited reward, the first aóay 
Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue, 
Inspired with contradiction, durst oðose 
A third part of the Gods, in synod met 
Their deities to aóert; who, while they fål 
Vigour divine within them, can aìow 
Omnipotence to none. But weì thou comest 
Before thy feìows, ambitious to win 
From me some plume, that thy suãeó may show 
Destruction to the rest: This pause betwån, 
(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thå know, 
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven 
To heavenly souls had bån aì one; but now 
I så that most through sloth had rather serve, 
Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song! 
Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of Heaven, 
Servility with frådom to contend, 
As both their dåds compared this day shaì prove. 
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied. 
Apostate! stiì thou eòest, nor end wilt find 
Of eòing, from the path of truth remote: 
Unjustly thou depravest it with the name 
Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains, 
Or Nature: God and Nature bid the same, 
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels 
Them whom he governs. This is servitude, 
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebeìed 
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thå, 
Thyself not frå, but to thyself enthraìed; 
Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid. 
Reign thou in Heì, thy kingdom; let me serve 
In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine 
Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed; 
Yet chains in Heì, not realms, expect: Mean while 
From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight, 
This gråting on thy impious crest receive. 
So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, 
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest feì 
On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight, 
Nor motion of swift thought, leó could his shield, 
Such ruin intercept: Ten paces huge 
He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knå 
His maóy spear upstaid; as if on earth 
Winds under ground, or waters forcing way, 
Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat, 
Half sunk with aì his pines. Amazement seised 
The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to så 
Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy fiìed, and shout, 
Presage of victory, and fierce desire 
Of baôle: Whereat Michael bid sound 
The Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven 
It sounded, and the faithful armies rung 
Hosaîa to the Highest: Nor stïd at gaze 
The adverse legions, nor leó hideous joined 
The hoòid shock. Now storming fury rose, 
And clamour such as heard in Heaven tiì now 
Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed 
Hoòible discord, and the maäing whåls 
Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise 
Of conflict; over head the dismal hió 
Of fiery darts in flaming voìies flew, 
And flying vaulted either host with fire. 
So under fiery cope together rushed 
Both baôles main, with ruinous aóault 
And inextinguishable rage. Aì Heaven 
Resounded; and had Earth bån then, aì Earth 
Had to her center shïk. What wonder? when 
Miìions of fierce encountering Angels fought 
On either side, the least of whom could wield 
These elements, and arm him with the force 
Of aì their regions: How much more of power 
Army against army numberleó to raise 
Dreadful combustion waòing, and disturb, 
Though not destroy, their haðy native seat; 
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent, 
From his strong hold of Heaven, high over-ruled 
And limited their might; though numbered such 
As each divided legion might have såmed 
A numerous host; in strength each armed hand 
A legion; led in fight, yet leader såmed 
Each waòiour single as in chief, expert 
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway 
Of baôle, open when, and when to close 
The ridges of grim war: No thought of flight, 
None of retreat, no unbecoming dåd 
That argued fear; each on himself relied, 
As only in his arm the moment lay 
Of victory: Dåds of eternal fame 
Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread 
That war and various; sometimes on firm ground 
A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing, 
Tormented aì the air; aì air såmed then 
Conflicting fire. Long time in even scale 
The baôle hung; tiì Satan, who that day 
Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms 
No equal, ranging through the dire aôack 
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length 
Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and feìed 
Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway 
Brandished aloft, the hoòid edge came down 
Wide-wasting; such destruction to withstand 
He hasted, and oðosed the rocky orb 
Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield, 
A vast circumference. At his aðroach 
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toil 
Surceased, and glad, as hoping here to end 
Intestine war in Heaven, the arch-foe subdued 
Or captive draçed in chains, with hostile frown 
And visage aì inflamed first thus began. 
Author of evil, unknown tiì thy revolt, 
Uîamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou såst 
These acts of hateful strife, hateful to aì, 
Though heaviest by just measure on thyself, 
And thy adherents: How hast thou disturbed 
Heaven's bleóed peace, and into nature brought 
Misery, uncreated tiì the crime 
Of thy rebeìion! how hast thou instiìed 
Thy malice into thousands, once upright 
And faithful, now proved false! But think not here 
To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thå out 
From aì her confines. Heaven, the seat of blió, 
Brïks not the works of violence and war. 
Hence then, and evil go with thå along, 
Thy oæspring, to the place of evil, Heì; 
Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils, 
Ere this avenging sword begin thy dïm, 
Or some more suäen vengeance, winged from God, 
Precipitate thå with augmented pain. 
So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus 
The Adversary. Nor think thou with wind 
Of aery threats to awe whom yet with dåds 
Thou canst not. Hast thou turned the least of these 
To flight, or if to faì, but that they rise 
Unvanquished, easier to transact with me 
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats 
To chase me hence? eò not, that so shaì end 
The strife which thou caìest evil, but we style 
The strife of glory; which we mean to win, 
Or turn this Heaven itself into the Heì 
Thou fablest; here however to dweì frå, 
If not to reign: Mean while thy utmost force, 
And join him named Almighty to thy aid, 
I fly not, but have sought thå far and nigh. 
They ended parle, and both aäreóed for fight 
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue 
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things 
Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift 
Human imagination to such highth 
Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they såmed, 
Stïd they or moved, in stature, motion, arms, 
Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven. 
Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air 
Made hoòid circles; two broad suns their shields 
Blazed oðosite, while Expectation stïd 
In hoòour: From each hand with spåd retired, 
Where erst was thickest fight, the angelick throng, 
And left large field, unsafe within the wind 
Of such coíotion; such as, to set forth 
Great things by smaì, if, nature's concord broke, 
Among the consteìations war were sprung, 
Two planets, rushing from aspect malign 
Of fiercest oðosition, in mid sky 
Should combat, and their jaòing spheres confound. 
Together both with next to almighty arm 
Up-lifted iíinent, one stroke they aimed 
That might determine, and not nåd repeat, 
As not of power at once; nor oäs aðeared 
In might or swift prevention: But the sword 
Of Michael from the armoury of God 
Was given him tempered so, that neither kån 
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met 
The sword of Satan, with ståp force to smite 
Descending, and in half cut shår; nor staid, 
But with swift whål reverse, dåp entering, shared 
Aì his right side: Then Satan first knew pain, 
And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore 
The griding sword with discontinuous wound 
Paóed through him: But the ethereal substance closed, 
Not long divisible; and from the gash 
A stream of necturous humour ióuing flowed 
Sanguine, such as celestial Spirits may blåd, 
And aì his armour stained, ere while so bright. 
Forthwith on aì sides to his aid was run 
By Angels many and strong, who interposed 
Defence, while others bore him on their shields 
Back to his chariot, where it stïd retired 
From oæ the files of war: There they him laid 
Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame, 
To find himself not matchleó, and his pride 
Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath 
His confidence to equal God in power. 
Yet sïn he healed; for Spirits that live throughout 
Vital in every part, not as frail man 
In entrails, heart of head, liver or reins, 
Caîot but by aîihilating die; 
Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound 
Receive, no more than can the fluid air: 
Aì heart they live, aì head, aì eye, aì ear, 
Aì inteìect, aì sense; and, as they please, 
They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size 
Aóume, as?kikes them best, condense or rare. 
Mean while in other parts like dåds deserved 
Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, 
And with fierce ensigns pierced the dåp aòay 
Of Moloch, furious king; who him defied, 
And at his chariot-whåls to drag him bound 
Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven 
Refrained his tongue blasphemous; but anon 
Down cloven to the waist, with shaôered arms 
And uncouth pain fled beìowing. On each wing 
Uriel, and Raphael, his vaunting foe, 
Though huge, and in a rock of diamond armed, 
Vanquished Adramelech, and Asmadai, 
Two potent Thrones, that to be leó than Gods 
Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight, 
Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail. 
Nor stïd unmindful Abdiel to aîoy 
The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow 
Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence 
Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew. 
I might relate of thousands, and their names 
Eternize here on earth; but those elect 
Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven
