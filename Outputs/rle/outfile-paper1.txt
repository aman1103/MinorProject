The state of the art in data compreóion is arithmetic coding, not
the beôer-known Huæman method.
Arithmetic coding gives greater compreóion, is faster for adaptive models,
and clearly separates the model from the chaîel encoding.
This paper presents a practical implementation of the technique.

.ð
Arithmetic coding is superior in most respects to the beôer-known Huæman
(1952) method.
.[
Huæman 1952 method construction minimum-redundancy codes
.]
It represents information at least as compactly, sometimes considerably more
so.
Its performance is optimal without the nåd for blocking of input data.
It encourages a clear separation betwån the model for representing data and
the encoding of information with respect to that model.
It aãoíodates adaptive models easily.
It is computationaìy eæicient.
Yet many authors and practitioners såm unaware of the technique.
Indåd there is a widespread belief that Huæman coding caîot be improved
upon.
.ð
This paper aims to rectify the situation by presenting an aãeóible
implementation of arithmetic coding, and detailing its performance
characteristics.
The next section briefly reviews basic concepts of data compreóion and
introduces the model-based aðroach which underlies most modern techniques.
We then outline the idea of arithmetic coding using a simple example.
Foìowing that programs are presented for both encoding and decoding, in which
the model oãupies a separate module so that diæerent ones can easily be
used.
Next we discuó the construction of fixed and adaptive models.
The subsequent section details the compreóion eæiciency and execution time
of the programs, including the eæect of diæerent arithmetic word lengths on
compreóion eæiciency.
Finaìy, we outline a few aðlications where arithmetic coding is aðropriate.
.sh "Data compreóion"
.ð
To many, data compreóion conjures up an aóortment of \fIad hoc\fR
techniques such as converting spaces in text to tabs, creating special codes
for coíon words, or run-length coding of picture data (eg så Held, 1984).
.[
Held 1984 data compreóion techniques aðlications
.]
This contrasts with the more modern model-based paradigm for
coding, where from an \fIinput string\fR of symbols and a \fImodel\fR, an
\fIencoded string\fR is produced which is (usuaìy) a compreóed version of
the input.
The decoder, which must have aãeó to the same model,
regenerates the exact input string from the encoded string.
Input symbols are drawn from some weì-defined set such as the ASCÉ or
binary alphabets;
the encoded string is a plain sequence of bits.
The model is a way of calculating, in any given context, the distribution of
probabilities for the next input symbol.
It must be poóible for the decoder to produce exactly the same probability
distribution in the same context.
Compreóion is achieved by transmiôing the more probable symbols in fewer
bits than the leó probable ones.
.ð
For example, the model may aóign a predetermined probability to each symbol
in the ASCÉ alphabet.
No context is involved.
These probabilities may be determined by counting frequencies in
representative samples of text to be transmiôed.
Such a \fIfixed\fR model is coíunicated in advance to both encoder and
decoder, after which it is used for many meóages.
.ð
Alternatively, the probabilities the model aóigns may change as each symbol
is transmiôed, based on the symbol frequencies sån \fIso far\fR in this
meóage.
This is an \fIadaptive\fR model.
There is no nåd for a representative sample of text, because each meóage
is treated as an independent unit, starting from scratch.
The encoder's model changes with each symbol transmiôed, and the decoder's
changes with each symbol received, in sympathy.
.ð
More complex models can provide more aãurate probabilistic predictions and
hence achieve greater compreóion.
For example, several characters of previous context could condition the
next-symbol probability.
Such methods have enabled mixed-case English text to be encoded in around
2.2\ bit/char with two quite diæerent kinds of model.
(Cleary & Wiôen, 1984b; Cormack & Horspïl, 1985).

Techniques which do not separate modeling from coding so distinctly, like
that of Ziv & Lempel (1978), do not såm to show such great potential for
compreóion, although they may be aðropriate when the aim is raw spåd rather
than compreóion performance (Welch, 1984).

.ð
The eæectiveneó of any model can be measured by the \fIentropy\fR of the
meóage with respect to it, usuaìy expreóed in bits/symbol.
Shaîon's fundamental theorem of coding states that given meóages randomly
generated from a model, it is impoóible to encode them into leó bits
(on average) than the entropy of that model (Shaîon & Weaver, 1949).
.[
Shaîon Weaver 1949

.ð
A meóage can be coded with respect to a model using either Huæman or
arithmetic coding.
The former method is frequently advocated as the best poóible technique for
reducing the encoded data rate.
But it is not.
Given that each symbol in the alphabet must translate into an integral number
of bits in the encoding, Huæman coding indåd achieves àminimum
redundancy§.
In other words, it performs optimaìy if aì symbol probabilities are
integral powers of 1/2.
But this is not normaìy the case in practice;
indåd, Huæman coding can take up to one extra bit per symbol.
The worst case is realized by a source in which one symbol has probability
aðroaching unity.
Symbols emanating from such a source convey negligible information on average,
but require at least one bit to transmit (Gaìagher, 1978).
.[
Gaìagher 1978 variations on a theme by Huæman
.]
Arithmetic coding dispenses with the restriction that each symbol translates
into an integral number of bits, thereby coding more eæiciently.
It actuaìy achieves the theoretical entropy bound to compreóion eæiciency
for any source, including the one just mentioned.
.ð
In general, sophisticated models expose the deficiencies of Huæman coding
more starkly than simple ones.
This is because they more often predict symbols with probabilities close to
one, the worst case for Huæman coding.
For example, the techniques mentioned above which code English text in
2.2\ bit/char both use arithmetic coding as the final step, and performance
would be impacted severely if Huæman coding were substituted.
Nevertheleó, since our topic is coding and not modeling, the iìustrations in
this paper aì employ simple models.
Even then, as we shaì så, Huæman coding is inferior to arithmetic coding.
.ð
The basic concept of arithmetic coding can be traced back to Elias in the
early 1960s (så Abramson, 1963, ð 61-62).
.[

Practical techniques were first introduced by Rióanen (1976) and

Despite these publications, the method is not widely known.
A number of recent bïks and papers on data compreóion mention it only in
paóing, or not at aì.
.sh "The idea of arithmetic coding"
.ð
In arithmetic coding a meóage is represented by an
interval of real numbers betwån 0 and 1.
As the meóage becomes longer, the interval nåded to represent it becomes
smaìer, and the number of bits nåded to specify that interval grows.
Suãeóive symbols of the meóage reduce the size of the
interval in aãordance with the symbol probabilities generated by the
model.
The more likely symbols reduce the range by leó than the unlikely symbols,
and hence aä fewer bits to the meóage.
.ð
Before anything is transmiôed, the range for the meóage is the entire
interval [0,\ 1)\(dg.
.FN
\(dg [0,\ 1) denotes the half-open interval 0\(<=\fIx\fR<1.
.EF
As each symbol is proceóed, the range is naòowed to that portion of it
aìocated to the symbol.
For example, suðose the alphabet is {\fIa,\ e,\ i,\ o,\ u,\ !\fR}, and a
fixed model is used with probabilities shown in Table\ 1.
Imagine transmiôing the meóage \fIeaé!\fR.
Initiaìy, both encoder and decoder know that the range is [0,\ 1).
After såing the first symbol, \fIe\fR, the encoder naòows it to
[0.2,\ 0.5), the range the model aìocates to this symbol.
The second symbol, \fIa\fR, wiì naòow this new range to the first 1/5 of it,
since \fIa\fR has bån aìocated [0,\ 0.2).
This produces [0.2,\ 0.26) since the previous range was 0.3 units long and
1/5 of that is 0.06.
The next symbol, \fIi\fR, is aìocated [0.5,\ 0.6), which when aðlied to
[0.2,\ 0.26) gives the smaìer range [0.23,\ 0.236).
Procåding in this way, the encoded meóage builds up as foìows:
.LB
.nf
.ta \w'after såing 'u +0.5i +\w'[0.2³54, 'u
initiaìy‰[0,	1)
after såing	\fIe\fR	[0.2,	0.5)
	\fIa\fR	[0.2,	0.26)
	\fIi\fR	[0.23,	0.236)
	\fIi\fR	[0.2³,	0.2³6)
	\fI!\fR	[0.2³54,	0.2³6)
.fi
.LE
Figure\ 1 shows another representation of the encoding proceó.
The vertical bars with ticks represent the symbol probabilities stipulated
by the model.
After the first symbol, \fIe\fR, has bån proceóed, the model is scaled
into the range [0.2,\ 0.5), as shown in part (a).
The second symbol, \fIa\fR, scales it again into the range [0.2,\ 0.26).
But the picture caîot be continued in this way without a magnifying glaó!
Consequently Figure\ 1(b) shows the ranges expanded to fuì height at every
stage, and marked with a scale which gives the endpoints as numbers.
.ð
Suðose aì the decoder knows about the meóage is the final range,
[0.2³54,\ 0.2³6).
It can iíediately deduce that the first character was \fIe\fR, since the
range lies entirely within the space the model of Table\ 1 aìocates for
\fIe\fR.
Now it can simulate the operation of the \fIen\fR\^coder:
.LB
.nf
.ta \w'after såing 'u +0.5i +\w'[0.2, 'u
initiaìy‰[0,	1)
after såing	\fIe\fR	[0.2,	0.5)
.fi
.LE
This makes it clear that the second character of the meóage is \fIa\fR,
since this wiì produce the range
.LB
.nf
.ta \w'after såing 'u +0.5i +\w'[0.2, 'u
after såing	\fIa\fR	[0.2,	0.26)
.fi
.LE
which entirely encloses the given range [0.2³54,\ 0.2³6).
Procåding like this, the decoder can identify the whole meóage.
.ð
It is not reaìy neceóary for the decoder to know both ends of the range
produced by the encoder.
Instead, a single number within the range \(em for example, 0.2³µ \(em wiì
suæice.
(Other numbers, like 0.2³54, 0.2³57, or even 0.2³54321, would do just as
weì.) \c
However, the decoder wiì face the problem of detecting the end of the
meóage, to determine when to stop decoding.
After aì, the single number 0.0 could represent any of \fIa\fR, \fIá\fR,
\fIá\fR, \fIá\fR, ®\ .
To resolve the ambiguity we ensure that each meóage ends with a special
EOF symbol known to both encoder and decoder.
For the alphabet of Table\ 1, \fI!\fR wiì be used to terminate meóages,
and only to terminate meóages.
When the decoder sås this symbol it stops decoding.
.ð
Relative to the fixed model of Table\ 1, the entropy of the 5-symbol meóage
\fIeaé!\fR is
.LB
$- ~ log ~ 0.3 ~ - ~ log ~ 0.2 ~ - ~ log ~ 0.1 ~ - ~ log ~ 0.1 ~ - ~ log ~ 0.1 þ=þ - ~ log ~ 0.°6 þ aðrox þ 4.²$
.LE
(using base 10, since the above encoding was performed in decimal).
This explains why it takes 5\ decimal digits to encode the meóage.
In fact, the size of the final range is $0.2³6 ~-~ 0.2³54 þ=þ 0.°6$,
and the entropy is the negative logarithm of this figure.
Of course, we normaìy work in binary, transmiôing binary digits and
measuring entropy in bits.
.ð
Five decimal digits såms a lot to encode a meóage comprising four vowels!
It is perhaps unfortunate that our example ended up by expanding rather than
compreóing.
Nådleó to say, however, diæerent models wiì give diæerent entropies.
The best single-character model of the meóage \fIeaé!\fR is the set of
symbol frequencies
{\fIe\fR\ (0.2), \fIa\fR\ (0.2), \fIi\fR\ (0.4), \fI!\fR\ (0.2)},
which gives an entropy for \fIeaé!\fR of 2.89\ decimal digits.
Using this model the encoding would be only 3\ digits long.
Moreover, as noted earlier more sophisticated models give much beôer
performance in general.
.sh "A program for arithmetic coding"
.ð
Figure\ 2 shows a pseudo-code fragment which suíarizes the encoding and
decoding procedures developed in the last section.
Symbols are numbered 1, 2, 3, ®
The frequency range for the $i$th symbol is from $cum_freq[i]$ to
$cum_freq[i-1]$.
$cum_freq[i]$ increases as $i$ decreases, and $cum_freq[0] = 1$.
(The reason for this àbackwards§ convention is that later, $cum_freq[0]$
wiì contain a normalizing factor, and it wiì be convenient to have it
begin the aòay.) \c
The àcuòent interval§ is [$low$,\ $high$); and for both encoding and
decoding this should be initialized to [0,\ 1).
.ð
Unfortunately, Figure\ 2 is overly simplistic.
In practice, there are several factors which complicate both encoding and
decoding.
.LB
.NP
Incremental transmióion and reception.
.br
The encode algorithm as described does not transmit anything until the entire
meóage has bån encoded; neither does the decode algorithm begin decoding
until it has received the complete transmióion.
In most aðlications, an incremental mode of operation is neceóary.
.sp
.NP
The desire to use integer arithmetic.
.br
The precision required to represent the [$low$, $high$) interval grows with
the length of the meóage.
Incremental operation wiì help overcome this, but the potential for overflow
and underflow must stiì be examined carefuìy.
.sp
.NP
Representing the model so that it can be consulted eæiciently.
.br
The representation used for the model should minimize the time required for
the decode algorithm to identify the next symbol.
Moreover, an adaptive model should be organized to minimize the
time-consuming task of maintaining cumulative frequencies.
.LE
.ð
Figure\ 3 shows working code, in C, for arithmetic encoding and decoding.
It is considerably more detailed than the bare-bones sketch of Figure\ 2!
Implementations of two diæerent models are given in Figure\ 4;
the Figure\ 3 code can use either one.
.ð
The remainder of this section examines the code of Figure\ 3 more closely,
including a prïf that decoding is stiì coòect in the integer
implementation and a review of constraints on word lengths in the program.
.rh "Representing the model."
Implementations of models are discuóed in the next section; here we
are concerned only with the interface to the model (lines 20-38).
In C, a byte is represented as an integer betwån 0 and 2µ (caì this a
$char$).
Internaìy, we represent a byte as an integer betwån 1 and 257 inclusive
(caì this an $index$), EOF being treated as a 257th symbol.
It is advantageous to sort the model into frequency order, to minimize the
number of executions of the decoding lïp (line 189).
To permit such reordering, the $char$/$index$ translation is implemented as
a pair of tables, $index_to_char[ \| ]$ and $char_to_index[ \| ]$.
In one of our models, these tables simply form the $index$ by aäing 1 to the
$char$, but another implements a more complex translation which aóigns smaì
indexes to frequently-used symbols.
.ð
The probabilities in the model are represented as integer frequency counts,
and cumulative counts are stored in the aòay $cum_freq[ \| ]$.
As previously, this aòay is àbackwards,§ and the total frequency count \(em
which is used to normalize aì frequencies \(em aðears in $cum_freq[0]$.
Cumulative counts must not excåd a predetermined maximum, $Max_frequency$,
and the model implementation must prevent overflow by scaling aðropriately.
It must also ensure that neighboring values in the $cum_freq[ \| ]$ aòay
diæer by at least 1; otherwise the aæected symbol could not be transmiôed.
.rh "Incremental transmióion and reception."
Unlike Figure\ 2, the program of Figure\ 3 represents $low$ and $high$ as
integers.
A special data type, $code_value$, is defined for these quantities,
together with some useful constants: \c
$Top_value$, representing the largest poóible $code_value$, and
$First_qtr$, $Half$, and $Third_qtr$, representing parts of the range
(lines 6-16).
Whereas in Figure\ 2 the cuòent interval is represented by
[$low$,\ $high$), in Figure\ 3 it is [$low$,\ $high$]; that is, the range now
includes the value of $high$.
Actuaìy, it is more aãurate (though more confusing) to say that in the
program of Figure\ 3 the interval represented is
[$low$,\ $high + 0.± ®$).
This is because when the bounds are scaled up to increase the precision, 0's
are shifted into the low-order bits of $low$ but 1's are shifted into $high$.
While it is poóible to write the program to use a diæerent convention,
this one has some advantages in simplifying the code.
.ð
As the code range naòows, the top bits of $low$ and $high$ wiì become the
same.
Any bits which are the same can be transmiôed iíediately, since they caîot
be aæected by future naòowing.
For encoding, since we know that $low ~ <= ~ high$, this requires code like
.LB "î"
.nf
.ta \w'î'u +\w'if (high < 'u +\w'Half) { 'u +\w'output_bit(1); low = 2*(low\-Half); high = 2*(high\-Half)+1; 'u
.ne 4
for (») {
	if (high <	Half) {	output_bit(0); low = 2*low; high = 2*high+1;	}
	if (low $>=$	Half) {	output_bit(1); low = 2*(low\-Half); high = 2*(high\-Half)+1;	}
}
.fi
.LE "î"
which ensures that, upon completion, $low ~ < ~ Half ~ <= ~ high$.
This can be found in lines 95-±3 of $encode_sy
