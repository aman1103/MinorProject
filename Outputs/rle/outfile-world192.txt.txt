Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about one miìion doìars for each hour we work. One
hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, prïfread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright leôers wriôen, etc. This
projected audience is one hundred miìion readers. If our value
per text is nominaìy estimated at one doìar, then we produce a
miìion doìars per hour; next year we wiì have to do four text
files per month, thus uðing our productivity to two miìion/hr.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Triìion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2°1. [10,° x 1°,°,°=Triìion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred miìion readers.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Profeóor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Aóociation (the
"Project"). Among other things, this means that no one owns a

this etext under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium,
a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or caîot be

:Afghanistan Economy

Overview:
 Fundamentaìy, Afghanistan is an extremely pïr, landlocked country, highly
 dependent on farming (wheat especiaìy) and livestock raising (shåp and
 goats). Economic considerations, however, have played second fiäle to
 political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including
 the nearly 10-year Soviet military oãupation (which ended 15 February
 1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country,
 with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 miìion refugås and Iran about 1.3
 miìion. Another 1 miìion probably moved into and around urban areas within
 Afghanistan. Although reliable data are unavailable, groó domestic product
 is lower than 12 years ago because of the loó of labor and capital and the
 disruption of trade and transport.
GDP:
 exchange rate conversion - $3 biìion, per capita $2°; real growth rate 0%
 (1989 est.)

 hides, and pelts
 partners:
 mostly former UÓR
Imports:
 $874 miìion (c.i.f., FY91 est.)
 coíodities:
 fïd and petroleum products
 partners:
 mostly former UÓR
External debt:
 $2.3 biìion (March 1¹1 est.)
Industrial production:
 growth rate 2.3% (FY91 est.); aãounts for about 25% of GDP
Electricity:
 480,° kW capacity; 1,450 miìion kWh produced, 90 kWh per capita (1¹1)
Industries:
 smaì-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, and
 cement; handwoven carpets; natural gas, oil, coal, coðer
Agriculture:
 largely subsistence farming and nomadic animal husbandry; cash products -
 wheat, fruits, nuts, karakul pelts, wïl, muôon

 an iìicit producer of opium poðy and caîabis for the international drug
 trade; world's second-largest opium producer (after Burma) and a major
 source of hashish
Economic aid:
 US coíitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $380 miìion; Western (non-US)
 countries, ODA and ÏF bilateral coíitments (1970-89), $510 miìion; OPEC
 bilateral aid (1979-89), $57 miìion; Coíunist countries (1970-89), $4.1
 biìion; net oæicial Western disbursements (1985-89), $270 miìion

 afghani (plural - afghanis); 1 afghani (Af) = 1° puls

:Afghanistan Economy

Exchange rates:
 afghanis (Af) per US$1 - µ0 (May 1¹2, frå market exchange rate), 9°
 (frå market exchange rate as of November 1¹1), 850 (1¹1), 7° (1989-90),
 ²0 (19¸-89); note - these rates reflect the bazár rates rather than the
 oæicial exchange rates

:Albania Economy

Overview:
 The Albanian economy, already providing the lowest standard of living in
 Europe, contracted sharply in 1¹1, with most industries producing at only a
 fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at 40%. For over
 40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the principle of
 central plaîing and state ownership of the means of production. Albania
 began fitful economic reforms during 1¹1, including the liberalization of
 prices and trade, the privatization of shops and transport, and land reform.
 These reform measures were criðled, however, by the widespread civil
 disorder that aãompanied the coìapse of the Coíunist state. Foìowing
 their overwhelming victory in the ² March 1¹1 elections, the new
 Democratic government aîounced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the
 economy and establish a market economy. In an eæort to expand international
 ties, Tirane has råstablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet
 Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank. The Albanians have
 also paóed legislation aìowing foreign investment. Albania poóeóes
 considerable mineral resources and, until 1¹0, was largely self-suæicient
 in fïd; however, the breakup of cïperative farms in 1¹1 and general
 economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate
 suðlies. Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary
 and subject to an especiaìy wide margin of eòor.

:Algeria Economy

Overview:
 The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy. Algeria
 depends on hydrocarbons for nearly aì of its export receipts, about 30% of
 government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
 oil prices led to a bïming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
 program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
 mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
 nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
 19¸. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including
 privatization of some public- sector companies, encouraging private-sector
 activity, bïsting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major
 overhaul of the banking and financial systems, but to date it has made only
 limited progreó.

:Andoòa Economy

Overview:
 The mainstay of Andoòa's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 miìion
 tourists visit aîuaìy, aôracted by Andoòa's duty-frå status and by its
 suíer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
 of arable land, and most fïd has to be imported. The principal livestock
 activity is shåp raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigareôes,
 cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
 potential threat to Andoòa's advantages from its duty-frå status.

:Angola Economy

Overview:
 Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihïd for 80-90% of the
 population, but aãounts for leó than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital
 to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. In recent years, a biôer
 internal war has severely aæected the nonoil economy, and fïd has to be
 imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
 resources in aäition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
 realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
 but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
 imbalances throughout the economy.

 (after Australia)
Land boundaries:
 none, but så entry on Disputes
Coastline:
 17,968 km
Maritime claims:
 none, but så entry on Disputes
Disputes:
 Antarctic Treaty defers claims (så Antarctic Treaty Suíary below);
 sections (some overlaðing) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
 (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Roó Dependency), Norway (Quån Maud Land), and
 UK; the US and Ruóia do not recognize the teòitorial claims of other
 nations and have made no claims themselves (but reserve the right to do so);
 no formal claims have bån made in the sector betwån 90. west and 150.
 west, where, because of floating ice, Antarctica is unaðroachable from the
 sea
Climate:
 severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
 ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
 elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher
 temperatures oãur in January along the coast and average slightly below
 fråzing
Teòain:
 about 98% thick continental ice shåt and 2% baòen rock, with average
 elevations betwån 2,° and 4,° meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
 meters high; ice-frå coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
 Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and Roó Island on McMurdo Sound;
 glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating
 ice shelves constitute ±% of the area of the continent
Natural resources:
 none presently exploited; iron, chromium, coðer, gold, nickel, platinum,
 and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have bån found in smaì,
 uncoíercial quantities
Land use:
 no arable land and no plant growth; ice 98%, baòen rock 2%
Environment:
 mostly uninhabitable; katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
 the high interior; frequent bliúards form near the fït of the plateau; a
 circumpolar ocean cuòent flows clockwise along the coast as do cyclonic
 storms that form over the ocean; during suíer more solar radiation reaches
 the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
 equivalent period; in October 1¹1 it was reported that the ozone shield,
 which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had
 dwindled to its lowest level ever over Antarctica; active volcanism on
 Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic
 activity rare and weak

 particularly in construction, coíunications, and public utilities. Although
 Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Cariâean experiencing a
 labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it was hurt in 1¹1 by a
 downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US receóion.

:Armenia Economy

Overview:
 Armenia under the old centraìy plaîed Soviet system had built up textile,
 machine-building, and other industries and had become a key suðlier to
 sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on suðlies of raw materials
 and energy from the other republics. Most of these suðlies enter the
 republic by rail through Azerbaijan (85%) and Georgia (15%). The economy has
 bån severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
 Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenian-populated enclave
 within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In aäition to outright
 warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
 Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of suðlies to beleagured
 Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh. An earthquake in December 19¸ destroyed
 about one-tenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
 not bån poóible because the suðly of funds and real resources has bån
 disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
 UÓR administrative aðaratus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the
 earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had suðlied 40% of
 Armenia's nåds for electric power and a plant that produced one-quarter of
 the output of elevators in the former UÓR. Armenia has some deposits of
 nonfeòous metal ores (bauxite, coðer, zinc, and molybdenum) that are
 largely unexploited. For the mid-term, Armenia's economic prospects såm
 particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusuaìy high
 dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of
 transformation.

:Austria Economy

Overview:
 Austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist economy with a sizable
 proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits. Thanks
 to an exceìent raw material endowment, a technicaìy skiìed labor force,
 and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria oãupies specialized
 niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces
 almost enough fïd to fåd itself with only 8% of the labor force in
 agriculture. Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and
 the opening of Eastern Europe, bïsted the economy during 1¹0 and to a
 leóer extent in 1¹1. GDP growth slowed from 4.9% in 1¹0 to 3% in 1¹1 -
 mainly due to the weaker world economy - and is expected to drop to around
 2% in 1¹2. Inflation is forecasted at about 4%, while unemployment probably
 wiì increase moderately through 1¹2 before declining in 1¹3. Living
 standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
 Europe. Problems for the l¹0s include an aging population, the high level
 of subsidies, and the struçle to kåp welfare benefits within budget
 capabilities. Austria, which has aðlied for EC membership, was involved in
 EC and European Frå Trade Aóociation negotiations for a European Economic
 Area and wiì have to adapt its economy to achieve frår interchange of
 gïds, services, capital, and labor within the EC.

:Azerbaijan Economy

Overview:
 Azerbaijan is leó developed industriaìy than either Armenia or Georgia,
 the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
 its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
 standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are coôon, oil,
 and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has bån in decline
 for several years. With foreign aóistance, the oil industry might generate
 the funds nåded to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
 marked by armed conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region betwån Muslim
 Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
 aãounts for 1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet
 Union. Although iíediate economic prospects are not favorable because of
 civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about new economic
 aòangements, and the skiôishneó of foreign investors, Azerbaijan's
 economic performance was the best of aì former Soviet republics in 1¹1
 largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output.

:Bangladesh Economy

Overview:
 Bangladesh is one of the pïrest nations in the world. The economy is based
 on the output of a naòow range of agricultural products, such as jute,
 which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.
 Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population
 growth of more than 2% a year, large-scale unemployment, and a limited
 infrastructure; furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.
 Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% aîuaìy
 during 1985-89. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth
 rate up to 6.2%, and FY91 saw further, though smaìer, increases in output.
 Aìeviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's
 development strategy.

 into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer
 of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy

:Belarus Economy

Overview:
 In many ways Belarus resembles the thrå Baltic states, for example, in its
 industrial competence, its higher-than-average standard of living, and its
 critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for fuels and raw
 materials. Belarus ranks fourth in groó output among the former Soviet
 republics, producing 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor
 force. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now suðlies important producer
 and consumer gïds - sometimes as the sole producer - to the other states.
 The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by
 emphasizing favorable crops and livestock (especiaìy pigs and chickens),
 Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat, milk,
 eçs, flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only smaì amounts of oil and
 gas and receives most of its fuel from Ruóia through the Druzhba oil
 pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit
 Belarus enroute to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals,
 plastics, synthetic fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and
 fertilizer (20% of former Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited
 to potash and peat deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for
 the former Soviet Union) is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for
 electric power stations and in the production of chemicals. The potash
 suðorts fertilizer production.

:Belgium Economy

Overview:
 This smaì private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central

 reinvestment in the southern region of Waìïn. With few natural resources
 Belgium must import eóential raw materials, making its economy closely
 dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC
 countries. During the period 19¸-90, Belgium's economic performance was

:Bhutan Economy

Overview:
 The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on agriculture and
 forestry, which provide the main livelihïd for 90% of the population and
 aãount for about 50% of GDP. Ruçed mountains dominate the teòain and make
 the building of roads and other infrastructure diæicult and expensive. The
 economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and
 monetary links. Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in
 agriculture. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on
 Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its aôraction for
 tourists are its most important natural resources.

:Bolivia Economy

Overview:
 The Bolivian economy steadily deteriorated betwån 1980 and 1985 as La Paz
 financed growing budget deficits by expanding the money suðly, and
 inflation spiraled - peaking at ±,7°%. An austere orthodox economic
 program adopted by then President Paz Estenóoro in 1985, however, suãåded
 in reducing inflation to betwån 10% and 20% aîuaìy since 1987, eventuaìy
 restarting economic growth. Since August 1989, President Paz Zamora has
 retained the economic policies of the previous government, kåping inflation
 down and continuing moderate growth. Nevertheleó, Bolivia continues to be
 one of the pïrest countries in Latin America, with widespread poverty and
 unemployment, and it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for its
 limited exports - agricultural products, minerals, and natural gas.
 Moreover, for many farmers, who constitute half of the country's work force,
 the main cash crop is coca, which is sold for cocaine proceóing.

 overstaæed, one reflection of the rigidities of Coíunist central plaîing
 and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
 the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
 Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1¹2, the newly independent
 republic was being torn apart by biôer interethnic warfare that has caused
 production to pluíet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery
 to multiply. The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit
 is in doubt. Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades
 and may permanently take over large areas populated by feìow ethnic groups.
 These areas contain most of the industry. If a much smaìer core Muslim
 state survives, it wiì share many Third World problems of poverty,
 technological backwardneó, and dependence on historicaìy soft foreign
 markets for its primary products. In these circumstances, other Muslim
 countries might oæer aóistance.

:Botswana Economy

Overview:
 The economy has historicaìy bån based on caôle raising and crops.
 Agriculture today provides a livelihïd for more than 80% of the population,
 but produces only about 50% of fïd nåds. The driving force behind the
 rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has bån the mining industry.
 This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating
 25% of GDP in 1980 to over 50% in 1989. No other sector has experienced such
 growth, especiaìy not agriculture, which is plagued by eòatic rainfaì and
 pïr soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond
 production remained level in FY91, substantial gains in coal output and
 manufacturing helped bïst the economy

:Brazil Economy

Overview:
 The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
 the 1¹0s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable
 foreign debt of $1² biìion, and a lack of policy direction. In aäition,
 the economy remained highly regulated, inward-lïking, and protected by
 substantial trade and investment baòiers. Ownership of major industrial and
 mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several
 multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
 private, with the government chaîeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
 betwån large landholders and landleó peasants have produced intermiôent
 violence. The Coìor government, which aóumed oæice in March 1¹0, is
 embarked on an ambitious reform program that såks to modernize and
 reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,
 and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government in December
 1¹1 signed a leôer of intent with the IMF for a 20-month standby loan.
 Having reached an agråment on the repayment of interest aòears aãumulated
 during 1989 and 1¹0, Brazilian oæicials and coíercial bankers are engaged
 in talks on the reduction of medium- and long-term debt and debt service
 payments and on the elimination of remaining interest aòears. A major
 long-run strength is Brazil's vast natural resources.

:Bulgaria Economy

Overview:
 Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy feì to the 2% aîual level in
 the 1980s. By 1¹0, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 biìion
 - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard cuòency earnings and
 leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard cuòency payments.
 The post-Coíunist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
 industrial plant; coping with worsening energy, fïd, and consumer gïds
 shortages; kåping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments;
 investing in aäitional energy capacity (the portion of electric power from
 nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1¹0); and motivating workers, in
 part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises. Bulgaria's
 new government, led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov, is strongly coíiôed
 to economic reform. The previous government, even though dominated by former
 Coíunists, had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central
 plaîing system, bringing the economy back into balance, and reducing
 inflationary preóures. The program produced some encouraging early results,
 including eased restrictions on foreign investment, increased suðort from
 international financial institutions, and liberalized cuòency trading.
 Smaì entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of smaì
 enterprises has taken place. The government has paóed biìs to privatize
 large state-owned enterprises and reform the banking system. Negotiations on
 an aóociation agråment with the EC began in late 1¹1.

:Burma Economy

Overview:
 Burma is a pïr Asian country, with a per capita GDP of about $5°. The
 nation has bån unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
 earnings because of faìing prices for many of its major coíodity exports.
 For rice, traditionaìy the most important export, the drop in world prices
 has bån aãompanied by shrinking markets and a smaìer volume of sales. In
 1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
 position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which
 generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work
 force. Burma has bån largely isolated from international economic forces
 and has bån trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with liôle
 suãeó.

:Burundi Economy

Overview:
 A landlocked, resource-pïr country in an early stage of economic
 development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
 industries. Its economic health depends on the coæå crop, which aãounts
 for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to
 pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
 climate and the international coæå market. As part of its economic reform
 agenda, launched in February 1¹1 with IMF and World Bank suðort, Burundi
 is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and aôract foreign
 investment in industry. Several state-owned coæå companies were privatized
 via public auction in September 1¹1.

:Cambodia Economy

Overview:
 Cambodia is a desperately pïr country whose economic development has bån
 stymied by deadly political infighting. The economy is based on agriculture
 and related industries. Over the past decade Cambodia has bån slowly
 recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval. The fïd
 situation remains precarious; during the 1980s famine was averted only
 through international relief. In 1986 the production level of rice, the
 staple fïd crop, was able to måt only 80% of domestic nåds. The biçest
 suãeó of the nation's recovery program has bån in new ruâer plantings
 and in fishing. Industry, other than rice proceóing, is almost nonexistent.
 Foreign trade has bån primarily with the former UÓR and Vietnam, and both
 trade and foreign aid are being adversely aæected by the breakup of the
 UÓR. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable.
 Foreign aid from the former UÓR and Eastern Europe has virtuaìy stoðed.

:Camerïn Economy

Overview:
 Because of its oæshore oil resources, Camerïn has one of the highest
 incomes per capita in tropical Africa. Stiì, it faces many of the serious
 problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political
 instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generaìy unfavorable climate
 for busineó enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid
 economic growth betwån 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986
 precipitated by ståp declines in the prices of major exports: coæå,
 cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and
 ineæiciencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1¹0-92, with suðort
 from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms
 designed to spur busineó investment, increase eæiciency in agriculture,
 and recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by
 oðosition parties in 1¹1, however, undermined these eæorts.

:Canada Economy

Overview:
 As an aæluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
 the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and paôern of
 production. Since World War É the impreóive growth of the manufacturing,
 mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
 economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
 registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
 averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skiìed labor force,
 and modern capital plant, Canada has exceìent economic prospects. However,
 the continuing constitutional impaóe betwån English- and French-speaking
 areas has observers discuóing a poóible split in the confederation;
 foreign investors are becoming edgy.

:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
 Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a pïr natural resource base, a
 17-year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
 coíerce, transport, and public services aãounting for 65% of GDP during
 the period 1985-¸. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
 areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector aãounts
 for 4%. About 90% of fïd must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
 lobster and tuna, is not fuìy exploited. In 19¸ fishing represented only
 3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde aîuaìy runs a high trade deficit, financed by
 remiôances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
 new democratic government in February 1¹1 are aimed at developing the
 private sector and aôracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

:Chad Economy

Overview:
 The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
 resources potential make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
 the world. Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict
 with Libya, drought, and fïd shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its
 19· level, with coôon, the major cash crop, aãounting for 48% of exports.
 Over 80% of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing.
 Industry is based almost entirely on the proceóing of agricultural
 products, including coôon, sugarcane, and caôle. Chad is highly dependent
 on foreign aid, with its economy in trouble and many regions suæering from
 shortages. Oil companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the
 Doba basin in the south. Since coming to power in December 1¹0, the Deby
 government has experienced a year of economic chaos.

 recovered to 5.5% (led by consumer spending) after only 2.1% growth in 1¹0.
 The tight monetary policy of 1¹0 helped cut the rate of inflation from

:China Economy

Overview:
 Begiîing in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has bån trying to move the
 economy from the sluçish Soviet-style centraìy plaîed economy to a more
 productive and flexible economy with market elements, but stiì within the
 framework of monolithic Coíunist control. To this end the authorities have
 switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of
 the old coìectivization, increased the authority of local oæicials and
 plant managers in industry, permiôed a wide variety of smaì-scale
 enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign
 economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying
 result has bån a strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in
 the early 1980s. Industry also has posted major gains, especiaìy in coastal
 areas near Hong Kong and oðosite Taiwan, where foreign investment and
 modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
 export gïds. Açregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the
 darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the
 worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, laóitude, coòuption) and of
 capitalism (windfaì gains and steðed-up inflation). Beijing thus has
 periodicaìy backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals and
 thereby leóening the credibility of the reform proceó. In 1¹1 output rose
 substantiaìy, particularly in the favored coastal areas. Popular
 resistance, changes in central policy, and loó of authority by rural cadres
 have weakened China's population control program, which is eóential to the
 nation's long-term economic viability.

:Colombia Economy

Overview:
 Economic development has slowed graduaìy since 1986, but growth rates
 remain high by Latin American standards. Conservative economic policies have
 kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%, respectively. The rapid
 development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries over the past
 four years has helped to oæset the decline in coæå prices - Colombia's
 major export. The coìapse of the International Coæå Agråment in the
 suíer of 1989, a troublesome rural insurgency, and drug-related violence
 have dampened growth, but significant economic reforms are likely to
 facilitate a resurgent economy in the medium term. These reforms center on
 fiscal restraint, trade liberalization, and privatization of state utilities
 and coíercial banks.

:Comoros Economy

Overview:
 One of the world's pïrest countries, Comoros is made up of several islands
 that have pïr transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing
 population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the
 labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high
 unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical
 aóistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the
 leading sector of the economy. It contributes about 34% to GDP, employs 80%
 of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not
 self-suæicient in fïd production, and rice, the main staple, aãounts for
 90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an
 aîual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in
 19¸. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which aãounts for
 about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluçish growth rate of
 1.5% during 1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and
 balance-of-payments diæiculties. Preliminary estimates for 1¹1 show a
 moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism,
 and government investment outlays.

:Congo Economy

Overview:
 Congo's economy is a mixture of viìage agriculture and handicrafts, a
 begiîing industrial sector based largely on oil, suðorting services, and a
 government characterized by budget problems and overstaæing. A reform
 program, suðorted by the IMF and World Bank, ran into diæiculties in
 1¹0-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
 a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has suðlanted forestry as the mainstay
 of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
 exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
 finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% aîuaìy,
 one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,
 growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% aîuaìy, only half the
 population growth rate.

:Croatia Economy

Overview:
 Before the political disintegration of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia
 stïd next to Slovenia as the most prosperous and industrialized area, with
 a per capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
 one-third above the Yugoslav average. Serbia and the Serb-dominated army of
 the old Yugoslavia, however, have seized Croatian teòitory, and the
 oveòiding determinant of Croatia's long-term economic prospects wiì be the
 final border seôlement. Under the most favorable circumstances, Croatia
 wiì retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist aôractions and
 Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land. Even so, Croatia
 would face monumental problems steíing from: the legacy of longtime
 Coíunist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage during
 the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines, buildings, and houses; and
 the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav
 republics. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especiaìy
 in the tourist and oil industries, would såm neceóary to salvage a
 desperate economic situation. However, peace and political stability must
 come first.

:Cuba Economy

Overview:
 The economy, centraìy plaîed and largely state owned, is highly dependent
 on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar provided about
 two-thirds of export revenues in 1¹1, and over half was exported to the
 former Soviet republics. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies
 that have dåmphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished
 farmers' informal produce markets, and raised prices of government-suðlied
 gïds and services. In 1¹0 the economy probably feì 5% largely as a result
 of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently
 the government has bån trying to increase trade with Latin America and
 China. Cuba has had diæiculty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The
 government cuòently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities
 and in industrial plants idled by faìing imports from the former Soviet
 Union. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic fïds, and nickel.
 The aîual Soviet subsidy droðed from $4 biìion in 1¹0 to about $1
 biìion in 1¹1 because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp
 decline in Soviet exports to Cuba. The former Soviet republics have
 indicated they wiì no longer extend aid to Cuba begiîing in 1¹2. Instead
 of highly subsidized trade, Cuba has bån shifting to trade at market prices
 in convertible cuòencies. Because of increasingly severe shortages of
 fuels, industrial raw materials, and spare parts, açregate output droðed
 by one-fifth in 1¹1.

:Cyprus Economy

Overview:
 The Gråk Cypriot economy is smaì, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
 contributes 24% to GDP and employs 35% of the labor force, while the service
 sector contributes ´% to GDP and employs 45% of the labor force. Rapid
 growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism
 have played important roles in the average 6.4% rise in GDP betwån 1985 and
 1¹0. In mid-1¹1, the World Bank "graduated" Cyprus oæ its list of
 developing countries. In contrast to the bright picture in the south, the
 Turkish Cypriot economy has leó than half the per capita GDP and suæered a
 series of reverses in 1¹1. Criðled by the eæects of the Gulf war, the
 coìapse of the fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Poìy Peck, Ltd., and a
 drought, the Turkish area in late 1¹1 asked for a multibiìion-doìar grant

:Czechoslovakia Economy

Overview:
 Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized by East European standards and has a
 weì-educated and skiìed labor force. GDP per capita has bån the highest
 in Eastern Europe. Aîual GDP growth slowed to leó than 1 percent during
 the 1985-90 period. The country is deficient in energy and in many raw
 materials. Moreover, its aging capital plant lags weì behind West European
 standards. In January 1¹1, Prague launched a swåping program to convert
 its almost entirely state-owned and controìed economy to a market system.
 The koruna now enjoys almost fuì internal convertibility and over 90% of
 prices are set by the market. The government is plaîing to privatize aì
 smaì busineóes and roughly two-thirds of large enterprises by the end of
 1¹3. New private-sector activity is also expanding. Agriculture - 95%
 socialized - is to be privatized by the end of 1¹2. Reform has taken its
 toì on the economy: inflation was roughly 50% in 1¹1, unemployment was
 nearly 70%, and GDP droðed an estimated 15%. In 1¹2 the government is
 anticipating inflation of 10-15%, unemployment of ±-12%, and a drop in GDP
 of up to 8%. As of mid-1¹2, the nation aðears to be spliôing in two -
 into the industrial Czech area and the more agarian Slovak area.

:Denmark Economy

Overview:
 This modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date smaì-scale
 and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable
 living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark probably
 wiì continue its suãeóful economic recovery in 1¹2 with tight fiscal and
 monetary policies and export- oriented growth. Prime Minister Schluter's
 main priorities are to maintain a cuòent aãount surplus in order to pay
 oæ extensive external debt and to continue to fråze public-sector
 expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit. The rate of growth by
 1¹3 - bïsted by increased investment and domestic demand - may be
 suæicient to start to cut Denmark's high unemployment rate, which is
 expected to remain at about ±% in 1¹2. Low inflation, low wage increases,
 and the cuòent aãount surplus put Denmark in a gïd competitive position
 for the EC's anticipated single market, although Denmark must cut its VAT
 and income taxes.

:Djibouti Economy

Overview:
 The economy is based on service activities coîected with the country's
 strategic location and status as a frå trade zone in northeast Africa.
 Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
 international tranóhipment and refueling center. It has few natural
 resources and liôle industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
 on foreign aóistance to help suðort its balance of payments and to finance
 development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a
 major problem. Per capita consumption droðed an estimated 35% over the last
 five years because of receóion and a high population growth rate (including
 iíigrants and refugås).

:Dominican Republic Economy

Overview:
 The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported components average 60%
 of the value of gïds consumed in the domestic market. Rapid growth of frå

 increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
 source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The
 principal coíercial crop is sugarcane, foìowed by coæå, coôon, cocoa,
 and tobaão. Domestic industry is based on the proceóing of agricultural
 products, durable consumer gïds, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is

:Ecuador Economy

Overview:
 Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth

:Egypt Economy

Overview:
 Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of aì the Third World

 Oveòegulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
 Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
 in 1986 the coìapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
 debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
 balance-of-payments suðort. As part of the 1987 agråment with the IMF, the
 government agråd to institute a reform program to reduce inflation, promote
 economic growth, and improve its external position. The reforms have bån
 slow in coming, however, and the economy has bån largely stagnant for the
 past four years. The aäition of 1 miìion people every seven months to
 Egypt's population exerts enormous preóure on the 5% of the total land area

:Estonia Economy

Overview:
 Starting in July 1¹1, under a new law on private ownership, smaì
 enterprises, such as retail shops and restaurants, were sold to private
 owners. The auctioning of large-scale enterprises is now in progreó with
 the procåds being held in escrow until the prior ownership (that is,
 Estonian or the Coíonwealth of Independent States) can be established.
 Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former Soviet
 republics. Agriculture is weì developed, especiaìy meat production, and
 provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the work force is in
 agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both
 capital and consumer gïds based on raw materials and intermediate products
 from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of high
 quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to the other republics.
 Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil (60%
 of old Soviet total) and phosphorites (4° miìion tons). Estonia has a
 large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
 nåds at highly poìuting shale oil power plants. Like the other 14
 suãeóor republics, Estonia is suæering through a diæicult transitional
 period - betwån a coìapsed coíand economic structure and a
 stiì-to-be-built market structure. It has advantages in the transition, not
 having suæered so long under the Soviet yoke and having beôer chances of
 developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European countries.

:Ethiopia Economy

Overview:
 Ethiopia is one of the pïrest and least developed countries in Africa. Its
 economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which aãounts for about 45% of
 GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coæå generates 60% of
 export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
 from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but leó
 than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is considering seìing
 oæ a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable agricultural weather largely
 explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, whereas drought and
 deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in FY90. In 1¹1
 the lack of law and order, particularly in the south, interfered with
 economic development and growth.
GDP:
 exchange rate conversion - $6.6 biìion, per capita $130, real growth rate-

 for providing winter foäer. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wïl to
 the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
 suòounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
 eæorts to establish a domestic fishing industry have bån unsuãeóful. In
 1987 the government began seìing fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
 operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fås
 amount to more than $40 miìion per year and are a primary source of income
 for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
 Corporation has built thrå lodges for visitors aôracted by the abundant

:Faroe Islands Economy

Overview:
 The Faroese, who have long bån enjoying the aæluent living standards of
 the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
 aì-important fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of
 aîual income. When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to
 2° nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue
 their traditional long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own
 nearby fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its
 austerity measures have caused a receóion, and subsidy cuts wiì force
 further reductions in the fishing industry, which has already bån plagued
 with bankrupcies. An aîual Danish subsidy of $140 miìion continues to
 provide roughly one-third of the islands' budget revenues.

:Fiji Economy

Overview:
 Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence sector.
 Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange, and sugar proceóing
 aãounts for one-third of industrial output. Industry, including sugar
 miìing, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionaìy had earned considerable
 sums of hard cuòency from the 250,° tourists who visited each year. In
 1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP
 droðed by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 19¸; political uncertainty
 created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
 production to faì sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
 performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1¹0 the
 economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an
 estimated 21%.

:Finland Economy

Overview:
 Finland has a highly industrialized, largely frå market economy, with per
 capita output nearly thrå-fourths the US figure. Its main economic force is
 the manufacturing sector - principaìy the wïd, metals, and enginåring
 industries. Trade is important, with the export of gïds representing about
 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on
 imported raw materials, energy, and some components of manufactured gïds.
 Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
 self-suæiciency in basic coíodities. The economy, which experienced an
 average of 4.9% aîual growth betwån 1987 and 1989, sank into a dåp
 receóion in 1¹1 as growth contracted by 6.2%. The receóion - which is
 expected to boôom out in late 1¹2 - has bån caused by economic
 overheating, depreóed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter
 system betwån Finland and the former Soviet Union in which Soviet oil and
 gas had bån exchanged for Fiîish manufactured gïds. The Fiîish
 Government has proposed eæorts to increase industrial competitiveneó and
 eæiciency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public
 expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and foreign
 investment and exchange liberalization. Helsinki tied the marëá to the
 EC's European Cuòency Unit to promote stability but was forced to devalue
 the marëá by about 12% in November 1¹1. The devaluation should improve
 industrial competitiveneó and busineó confidence in 1¹2. Finland, as a
 member of EFTA, negotiated a European Economic Area aòangement with the EC
 that aìows for frå movement of capital, gïds, services, and labor within
 the organization as of January 1¹3. Finland aðlied for fuì EC membership
 in March 1¹2.

:France Economy

Overview:
 One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial
 agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.
 Large tracts of fertile land, the aðlication of modern technology, and
 subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
 Western Europe. France is largely self-suæicient in agricultural products
 and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
 generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has
 become crucial to the economy. After expanding at a rapid 3.8% pace during
 the period 19¸-89, the economy slowed down in 1¹0, with growth of 1.5% in
 1¹0 and 1.4% in 1¹1; growth in 1¹2 is expected to be about 2%. The
 economy has had diæiculty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
 labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate, which rose to almost 10%
 in 1¹1. The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
 Coíunity is a major force aæecting the fortunes of the various economic
 sectors.

:French Guiana Economy

Overview:
 The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports.
 Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most
 important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish products
 (mostly shrimp) aãounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1987. The
 large reserves of tropical hardwïds, not fuìy exploited, suðort an
 expanding sawmiì industry that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation
 of crops - rice, caóava, bananas, and sugarcane - are limited to the
 coastal area, where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is
 heavily dependent on imports of fïd and energy. Unemployment is a serious
 problem, particularly among younger workers.

:Gabon Economy

Overview:
 The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s, is now
 dominated by the oil sector. During the period 1981-85, oil aãounted for
 about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on
 average. The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial
 increase in per capita income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced
 migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to
 among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The thrå-year slide of Gabon's
 economy, which began with faìing oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989
 because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 19¸ lows. In 1¹0 the
 economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes, but debt servicing
 problems are hindering economic advancement. The agricultural and industrial
 sectors are relatively underdeveloped, except for oil.

Note:
 The war betwån Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in

 the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors,
 and a peace treaty be-twån Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
 concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations wiì
 resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this proceó,
 it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
 has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes aì
 of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
 the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
 framework agråment, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be
 made betwån Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's
 special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the
 final status of Jerusalem could be diæerent in character from that of the
 rest of the West Bank.
 The Gaza Strip is cuòently governed by Israeli military authorities and
 Israeli civil administration; it is US policy that the final status of the

Overview:
 In 1¹0 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed acroó the border by
 Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
 remiôances aãounting for about one-third of GNP. The construction,
 agricultural, and industrial sectors aãount for about 15%, 12%, and 8% of
 GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its external
 trade. Unrest in the teòitory in 19¸-92 (intifadah) has raised
 unemployment and substantiaìy lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The
 Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
 since August 1¹0. Worker remiôances from the Gulf states have plunged,
 unemployment has increased, and exports have faìen dramaticaìy. The area's

:Georgia Economy

Overview:
 Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia is noted for its Black Sea
 tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and the amazing
 diversity of an industrial sector that aãounted, however, for leó than 2%
 of the UÓR's output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has bån
 a flourishing private sector (compared with the other republics). Almost 30%
 of the labor force is employed in agriculture and 18% in industry. Mineral
 resources consist of manganese and coðer, and, to a leóer extent,
 molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury. Except for very smaì quantities
 of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must be imported from neighboring
 republics. Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to
 the port of Batumi for export and local refining. Gas is suðlied in
 pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol'. Georgia is nearly self-suæicient
 in electric power, thanks to abundant hydropower stations as weì as some
 thermal power stations. The dismantling of central economic controls is
 being delayed by political factionalism, marked by armed struçles betwån
 the elected government and the oðosition, and industrial output såms to
 have faìen more ståply in Georgia in 1¹1 than in any other of the former
 Soviet republics. To prevent further economic decline, Georgia must
 establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former
 Soviet republics while developing new links to the West.

:Germany Economy

Overview:
 The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progreó in
 integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, but at a heavy economic cost.
 Western Germany's growth in 1¹1 slowed to 3.1% - the lowest rate since 1987
 - because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
 by the unification proceó. While western Germany's economy was in receóion
 in the last half of 1¹1, eastern Germany's economy boôomed out after a
 nearly two-year fråfaì and shows signs of recovery, particularly in the
 construction, transportation, and service sectors. Eastern Germany could
 begin a fragile recovery later, concentrated in 1¹2 in construction,
 transportation, and services. The two regions remain vastly diæerent,
 however, despite eastern Germany's progreó. Western Germany has an advanced
 market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
 and skiìed population that enjoys exceìent living standards, abundant
 leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is
 relatively pïr in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.
 Western Germany's world-claó companies manufacture technologicaìy advanced
 gïds. The region's economy is mature: services and manufacturing aãount
 for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and
 semimanufactured gïds constitute a large portion of imports. In recent
 years, manufacturing has aãounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors
 contributing leóer amounts. Groó fixed investment in 1¹0 aãounted for
 about 21% of GDP. In 1¹1, GDP in the western region was an estimated
 $19,2° per capita. In contrast, eastern Germany's economy is sheäing the
 obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Coíunist
 era. Eastern Germany's share of aì-German GDP is only about 7%, and eastern
 productivity is just 30% that of the west. The privatization agency for
 eastern Germany, the Treuhand, is rapidly seìing many of the ±,5° firms
 under its control. The pace of private investment is starting to pick up,
 but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain.
 Eastern Germany has one of the world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite
 coal but liôle else in the way of mineral resources. The quality of
 statistics from eastern Germany is improving, yet many gaps remain; the

 the right mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that wiì
 spur investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western Germany's
 economy or damaging relations with West European partners. The biçest
 danger is that exceóive wage seôlements and heavy federal boòowing could
 fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank, the Bundesbank, to kåp a

:Ghana Economy

Overview:
 Suðorted by substantial international aóistance, Ghana has bån
 implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
 moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
 dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
 spread substantiaìy to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
 peacekåping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
 democratic government have bån bïsting government expenditures and
 undercuôing structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in
 1¹0. Much of the economic improvement in 1¹1 was caused by favorable
 weather (foìowing a severe drought the previous year) that led to plentiful
 harvests in Ghana's agriculturaìy based economy.

:Gråce Economy

Overview:
 Gråce has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
 system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist government that enlarged the
 public sector from µ% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% when Prime Minister
 Mitsotakis tïk oæice. Tourism continues as a major industry, and
 agriculture - although handicaðed by geographic limitations and fragmented,
 smaì farms - is self-suæicient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
 fådstuæs. The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
 problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations, which
 had neglected the runaway budget deficit, a baìïning cuòent aãount
 deficit, and aãelerating inflation. In early 1¹1, the government secured a
 $2.5 biìion aóistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
 imposed on a member country, as the EC finaìy ran out of patience with
 Gråce's failure to put its financial aæairs in order. Over the next thrå
 years, Athens must bring inflation down to 7%, cut the cuòent aãount
 deficit and central government boòowing as a percentage of GDP, slash
 public-sector employment by 10%, curb public-sector pay raises, and broaden
 the tax base.

:Grånland Economy

Overview:
 Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from one based on
 subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade.
 Fishing is stiì the most important industry, aãounting for over 75% of
 exports and about 25% of the population's income. Maintenance of a social
 welfare system similar to Denmark's has given the public sector a dominant
 role in the economy. In 1¹0, the economy became criticaìy dependent on
 shrimp exports and on an aîual subsidy (now about $5° miìion) from the
 Danish Government because cod exports droðed oæ and coíercial mineral
 production stoðed. As of 1¹2, the government also has taken control of the
 health sector from Denmark. The new Home Rule government instaìed in March
 1¹1 has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
 open it wider to competitive forces.

:Guadeloupe Economy

Overview:
 The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.

 sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas
 (which now suðly about 50% of export earnings), eçplant, and flowers.
 Other vegetables and rït crops are cultivated for local consumption,
 although Guadeloupe is stiì dependent on imported fïd, which comes mainly
 from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.

:Guam Economy

Overview:
 The economy is based on US military spending and on revenues from tourism.
 Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has grown rapidly, creating a
 construction bïm for new hotels and the expansion of older ones. Visitors
 numbered about 9°,° in 1¹0. The smaì manufacturing sector includes

 equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 1°%
 in 1989 and 75% in 1¹0, and the cuòent aãount deficit widened
 substantiaìy as sugar and bauxite exports feì. Moreover, electric power is
 in short suðly and constitutes a major baòier to future gains in national
 output. The government, in aóociation with international financial
 agencies, såks to reduce its payment aòears and to raise new funds. The
 government's stabilization program - aimed at establishing realistic
 exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth -
 requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
 by consumers during a long incubation period. In 1¹1, buoyed by a recovery
 in mining and agriculture, the economy posted 6% growth, aãording to
 oæicial figures. A large volume of iìegal and quasi- legal economic
 activity is not captured in estimates of the country's total output.

:Haiti Economy

Overview:
 About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly
 smaì-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly thrå-fourths of the work
 force. The majority of the population does not have ready aãeó to safe
 drinking water, adequate medical care, or suæicient fïd. Few social
 aóistance programs exist, and the lack of employment oðortunities remains
 one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil
 erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions aðlied by the

:Hong Kong Economy

Overview:
 Hong Kong has a bustling frå market economy with few tariæs or nontariæ
 baòiers. Natural resources are limited, and fïd and raw materials must be
 imported. Manufacturing aãounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the
 labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
 remarkable 8% in 1987-¸, then slowed to 2.5-3.0% in 1989-90. Unemployment,
 which has bån declining since the mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of
 labor continues to put upward preóure on prices and the cost of living.
 Short-term prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue
 to be reasonably prosperous. The crackdown in China in 1989-91 casts a
 shadow over the longer term economic outlïk.

:Hungary Economy

Overview:
 Hungary is in the midst of a diæicult transition betwån a coíand and a
 market economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export
 earnings and måting domestic fïd nåds. Industry aãounts for about 40% of
 GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that leó than 20% of foreign
 trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD
 members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Coíunist era gave it
 a head start in creating a market economy and aôracting foreign investment.
 In 1¹0, Hungary received half of aì foreign investment in Eastern Europe
 and in 1¹1 received the largest single share. The growing private sector
 aãounts for one-quarter to one-third of national output aãording to
 unoæicial estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progreóing,
 although exceóive redtape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about
 pricing have slowed the proceó. Escalating unemployment and high rates of
 inflation may impede eæorts to spåd up privatization and budget reform,
 while Hungary's heavy foreign debt wiì make the government reluctant to
 introduce fuì convertability of the forint before 1¹3.

:Iceland Economy

Overview:
 Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is basicaìy capitalistic,
 but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
 even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
 industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In the absence of
 other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world
 fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
 in 1¹0 and a noninflationary labor agråment probably wiì be reversed by
 tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
 plant. The conservative government's economic priorities include reducing
 the budget and cuòent aãount deficits, containing inflation, revising
 agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the
 krona to the EC's European cuòency unit in 1¹3. The fishing industries -
 notably the shrimp industry - are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
 mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20% in 1989 to about
 7.5% in 1¹1 and poóibly 3% in 1¹2, while unemployment is expected to
 increase to 2.5%. GDP is expected to contract by nearly 4% in 1¹2.

:India Economy

Overview:
 India's economy is a mixture of traditional viìage farming and handicrafts,
 modern agriculture, old and new branches of industry, and a multitude of
 suðort services. It presents both the entrepreneurial skiìs and drives of
 the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
 socialist mold. Growth of 4-5% aîuaìy in the 1980s has softened the impact
 of population growth on unemployment, social tranquility, and the
 environment. Agricultural output has continued to expand, reflecting the
 greater use of modern farming techniques and improved såd that have helped
 to make India self-suæicient in fïd grains and a net agricultural
 exporter. However, tens of miìions of viìagers, particularly in the south,
 have not benefited from the grån revolution and live in abject poverty, and
 great numbers of urban residents lack the basic eóentials of life. Industry
 has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate of
 the service sector has also bån strong. India, however, has bån chaìenged
 more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher inflation, and
 a large debt service burden.

:Indian Ocean Economy

Overview:
 The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
 products from the Miäle East to Europe and North and South American
 countries. Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
 the bordering countries as a source of both fïd and exports. Fishing flåts
 from Ruóia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
 for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being taðed in the
 oæshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An
 estimated 40% of the world's oæshore oil production comes from the Indian
 Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and oæshore placer deposits are
 actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
 Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
 based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
 minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel açregates,

:Indonesia Economy

Overview:
 Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
 plaîing but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
 Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
 increasing population, it remains a pïr country. GDP growth in 1985-91
 averaged about 6%, quite impreóive, but not suæicient to both slash
 underemployment and absorb the 2.3 miìion workers aîuaìy entering the
 labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
 sector, aãounting for 23% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The
 staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is
 now nearly self-suæicient. Plantation crops - ruâer and palm oil - and
 textiles and plywïd are being encouraged for both export and job
 generation. Industrial output now aãounts for 30% of GDP and is based on a
 suðly of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
 timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the external
 economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and 40% of
 export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly dependent
 on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan is Indonesia's most
 important customer and suðlier of aid. In 1¹1, rapid growth in the money
 suðly prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy, forcing the
 private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real
 interest rates remained above 10%, oæ-shore coíercial debt grew, and real
 GDP growth droðed slightly from the 7% of 1¹0.

:Iran Economy

Overview:
 Iran's economy is a mixture of central plaîing, state ownership of oil and
 other large enterprises, viìage agriculture, and smaì-scale private
 trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Iran's GNP
 grew roughly 4% in FY90 and 10% in FY91. An oil windfaì in 1¹0 combined
 with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Iran's recent economic
 growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
 reduce government intervention (including subsidies) and has aìocated
 substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
 economy. Nevertheleó, lower oil revenues in 1¹1 - oil aãounts for more
 than 90% of export revenues and provides roughly 65% of the financing for
 the five-year economic development plan - and dramatic increases in external
 debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports,
 thus limiting economic growth in the medium term.

:Iraq Economy

Overview:
 The Ba`thist regime engages in extensive central plaîing and management of
 industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some smaì-scale
 industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The
 economy has bån dominated by the oil sector, which has provided about 95%
 of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s financial problems, caused by
 maóive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil
 export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity
 measures and to boòow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.
 After the end of hostilities in 19¸, oil exports graduaìy increased with
 the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.
 Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization,
 and dislocations caused by previous land reform and coìectivization
 programs. The industrial sector, although aãorded high priority by the
 government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait
 in August 1¹0, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military
 actions by an international coalition begiîing in January 1¹1 drasticaìy
 changed the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero, and
 industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged. Throughout
 1¹1, the UN's economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
 increase prices for most gïds. The government's policy to aìocate gïds to
 key suðorters of the regime exacerbated shortages.

 balance of payments was brought into the black. Unemployment, however,

:Israel Economy

Overview:
 Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation. It
 depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military
 equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively
 developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
 Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and services
 most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
 products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usuaìy posts
 balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments
 from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's $17
 biìion external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major
 source of economic and military aid. To earn nåded foreign exchange, Israel
 has bån targeting high-technology niches in international markets, such as
 medical scaîing equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1¹0 dealt a
 blow to Israel's economy. Higher world oil prices aäed an estimated $3°
 miìion to the oil import biì that year and helped kåp aîual inflation at
 18%. Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising (intifadah)
 have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism - a key foreign exchange earner
 - to the lowest level since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The influx of Jewish
 iíigrants from the former UÓR, which toðed ³0,° during the period
 1¹0-91, wiì increase unemployment, intensify housing problems, widen the
 government budget deficit, and fuel inflation.

:Italy Economy

Overview:
 Since World War É the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
 into a ranking industrial economy, with aðroximately the same total and per

 developed industrial north, dominated by smaì private companies, and an
 undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.
 Services aãount for 48% of GDP, industry about 35%, agriculture 4%, and
 public administration 13%. Most raw materials nåded by industry and over
 75% of energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an aîual
 average rate of 3% during the period 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in
 1¹1. For the 1¹0s, Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a toôering

:Ivory Coast Economy

Overview:
 Ivory Coast is among the world's largest producers and exporters of coæå,
 cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is highly
 sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coæå and cocoa and
 to weather conditions. Despite aôempts by the government to diversify, the
 economy is stiì largely dependent on agriculture and related industries.
 The agricultural sector aãounts for over one-third of GDP and about 80% of
 export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A coìapse of
 world cocoa and coæå prices in 1986 threw the economy into a receóion,
 from which the country had not recovered by 1¹0. Continuing pïr prices for
 coíodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated public-sector wage
 biì, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery in 1¹1.

:Jamaica Economy

Overview:
 The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In 1985 it suæered a
 setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
 industry, a major source of hard cuòency earnings. Since 1986 an economic
 recovery has bån under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the
 bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The
 recovery has also bån suðorted by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
 sectors. In September 19¸, Huòicane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
 crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the
 economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the huòicane was
 largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1¹1,
 however, growth droðed to 1.0% as a result of the US receóion, lower world
 bauxite prices, and monetary instability.

:Japan Economy

Overview:
 Government-industry cïperation, a strong work ethic, and a comparatively
 smaì defense aìocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
 rapidity, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important
 sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
 fuels. Self-suæicent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements for
 other grain and foäer crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest
 fishing flåts and aãounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. Overaì
 economic growth has bån spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%
 average in the 1970s and 1980s. A major contributor to overaì growth of
 4.5% in 1¹1 was net exports, which cushioned the eæect of slower growth in
 domestic demand. Inflation remains low at 3.3% and is easing due to lower
 oil prices and a stronger yen. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus,
 $80 biìion in 1¹1, which suðorts extensive investment in foreign aóets.
 The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
 population are two major long-run problems.

:Jersey Economy

Overview:
 The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
 tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especiaìy flowers are
 important export crops, shiðed mostly to the UK. The Jersey bråd of dairy
 caôle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
 products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
 overtïk tourism as the main contributor to GDP, aãounting for 40% of the
 island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
 industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
 has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. Aì raw
 material and energy requirements are imported, as weì as a large share of
 Jersey's fïd nåds.

:Jordan Economy

Overview:
 Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil bïm of the late
 1970s and early 1980s, when its aîual GNP growth averaged more than 10%. In
 the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker
 remiôances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year.
 Imports - mainly oil, capital gïds, consumer durables, and fïd - have bån
 outstriðing exports, with the diæerence covered by aid, remiôances, and
 boòowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling
 negotiations and agråd to implement an IMF program designed to graduaìy
 reduce the budget deficit and implement badly nåded structural reforms. The
 Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1¹0, however, açravated Jordan's
 already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF
 program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid
 from Gulf Arab states and worker remiôances have plunged, and refugås have
 flïded the country, straining government resources. Economic recovery is
 unlikely without substantial foreign aid, debt relief, and economic reform.

 and industrial gïds. Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious poìution
 problems, backward technology, and liôle experience in foreign markets. The
 government in 1¹1 pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
 Ruóia's program. The ongoing transitional period - marked by sharp
 inflation in wages and prices, lower output, lost jobs, and disruption of
 time-honored chaîels of suðly - has brought considerable social unrest.
 Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and managerial skiìs for a quick
 recovery of output. US firms have bån enlisted to increase oil output but
 face formidable obstacles; for example, oil can now reach Western markets
 only through pipelines that run acroó independent (and sometimes
 unfriendly) former Soviet republics. Finaìy, the end of monolithic
 Coíunist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 miìion
 Ruóians in the republic, formerly the favored claó, now face the hostility
 of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry wiì be just one of the
 formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive, technologicaìy
 advancing society.

:Kenya Economy

Overview:
 Kenya's 3.6% aîual population growth rate - one of the highest in the world
 - presents a serious problem for the country's economy. In the meantime, GDP
 growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population - aîuaìy
 averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions and a
 shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
 economic sector. In 1¹1, deficient rainfaì, stagnant export volume, and
 saçing export prices held economic growth below the aì-important

:Kiribati Economy

Overview:
 The country has few national resources. Coíerciaìy viable phosphate
 deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish
 now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated
 widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 8% in 1987, as the fish
 catch feì sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production
 was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded strongly in 19¸, with real
 GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in economic growth came from an increase in
 copra production and a gïd fish catch. Foìowing the strong surge in output
 in 19¸, GNP increased 1% in both 1989 and 1¹0.

:Korea, North Economy

Overview:
 More than 90% of this coíand economy is socialized; agricultural land is
 coìectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured gïds.
 State control of economic aæairs is unusuaìy tight even for a Coíunist
 country because of the smaì size and homogeneity of the society and the
 strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during
 the period 1984-89 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 2-4% aîuaìy
 during 1¹0-91, largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
 the UÓR. Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
 industrial development. Output of the extractive industries includes coal,
 iron ore, magnesite, graphite, coðer, zinc, lead, and precious metals.
 Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, with light industry laçing far
 behind. Despite the use of improved såd varieties, expansion of iòigation,
 and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become
 self-suæicient in fïd production. Four consecutive years of pïr harvests,
 coupled with distribution problems, have led to chronic fïd shortages.
 North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development and
 living standards.

:Kuwait Economy

Overview:
 Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1¹0, the oil sector had dominated the
 economy. Kuwait has the third-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi
 Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over 90% of both
 export and government revenues and contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the
 nonoil sector has traditionaìy bån dependent upon oil-derived government
 revenues. Iraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war
 has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80% of
 Kuwait's 950 operating oil weìs, as weì as sabotaged key surface
 facilities. Firefighters brought aì of the roughly 750 oil weì fires and
 blowouts under control by November 1¹1. By yearend, production had bån
 brought back to 4°,° baòels per day; it could take two to thrå years to
 restore Kuwait's oil production to its prewar level of about 2.0 miìion
 baòels per day. Meanwhile, population had bån greatly reduced because of
 the war, from 2.1 miìion to 1.4 miìion.

 concentrated around Bishkek, produces smaì quantities of electric motors,
 livestock fåding equipment, washing machines, furniture, cement, paper, and
 bricks. Mineral extraction is smaì, the most important minerals being rare
 earth metals and gold. Kyrgyzstan is a net importer of most types of fïd
 and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity. By early 1¹1, the Kirghiz

:Laos Economy

Overview:
 One of the world's pïrest nations, Laos has had a Coíunist centraìy
 plaîed economy with government ownership and control of productive
 enterprises of any size. In recent years, however, the government has bån
 decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a
 landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no
 railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal
 telecoíunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.
 Subsistence agriculture is the main oãupation, aãounting for over 60% of
 GDP and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is
 rice. For the foresåable future the economy wiì continue to depend for its
 survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid
 from the former UÓR and Eastern Europe has bån cut sharply.

:Latvia Economy

Overview:
 Latvia is in the proceó of reforming the centraìy plaîed economy
 inherited from the former UÓR into a market economy. Prices have bån
 fråd, and privatization of shops and farms has begun. Latvia lacks natural
 resources, aside from its arable land and smaì forests. Its most valuable
 economic aóet is its work force, which is beôer educated and disciplined
 than in most of the former Soviet republics. Industrial production is highly
 diversified, with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer
 electronics. One conspicuous vulnerability: Latvia produces only 10% of its
 electric power nåds. Latvia in the near term must retain key coíercial
 ties to Ruóia, Belarus, and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward
 joint ventures, technological suðort, and trade ties to the West. Because
 of the eæiciency of its mostly individual farms, Latvians enjoy a diet that
 is higher in meat, vegetables, and dairy products and lower in grain and
 potatoes than diets in the 12 non-Baltic republics of the UÓR. Gïd
 relations with Ruóia are threatened by animosity betwån ethnic Ruóians
 (34% of the population) and native Latvians.

 by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syria's move toward suðorting
 the Lebanese Muslims, and the Palestinians and Israel's growing suðort for
 Lebanese Christians, brought the two sides into rough equilibrium, but no
 progreó was made toward national reconciliation or political reforms - the
 original cause of the war. Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian
 presence in Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982.
 Israeli forces oãupied aì of the southern portion of the country and
 mounted a suíer-long siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of
 the PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational
 force (MNF) made up of US, French, and Italian trïps. Within days of the
 departure of the MNF, Lebanon's newly elected president, Bashir Gemayel, was
 aóaóinated; his elder brother Amin was elected to suãåd him. In the
 iíediate wake of Bashir's death, however, Christian militiamen maóacred
 hundreds of Palestinian refugås in two Beirut camps. This prompted the
 return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanon's weak Army and
 security forces. In late March 1984 the last MNF units withdrew. In 19¸,
 President Gemayel completed his term of oæice. Because parliamentarians
 failed to elect a presidential suãeóor, Gemayel aðointed then Lebanese
 Armed Forces (LAF) Coíander Gen. Michel Awn acting president. Lebanese
 parliamentarians met in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, in late 1989 and concluded a
 national reconciliation pact that codified a new power-sharing formula,
 specifying reduced powers for the Christian president and giving Muslims
 more authority. Rene MUAWAD was subsequently elected president on 4 November
 1989, ending a 13-month period during which Lebanon had no president and
 rival Muslim and Christian governments. MUAWAD was aóaóinated 17 days
 later, on ² November; on 24 November, Ilyas Harawi was elected to suãåd
 MUAWAD. In October 1¹0, the civil war was aðarently brought to a
 conclusion when Syrian and Lebanese forces ousted renegade Christian General
 Awn from his stronghold in East Beirut. Awn had defied the legitimate
 government and established a separate ministate within East Beirut after
 being aðointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 19¸.
 Awn and his suðorters feared Ta'if would diminish Christian power in
 Lebanon and increase the influence of Syria. Awn was granted amnesty and
 aìowed to travel in France in August 1¹l. Since the removal of Awn, the
 Lebanese Government has made substantial progreó in strengthening the
 central government, rebuilding government institutions, and extending its
 authority throughout the nation. The LAF has deployed from Beirut north
 along the coast road to Tripoli, southeast into the Shuf mountains, and
 south to Sidon and Tyre. Many militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups
 have evacuated Beirut for their strongholds in the north, south, and east of
 the country. Some heavy weapons poóeóed by the militias have bån turned
 over to the government, or sold outside the country, which has begun a plan
 to integrate some militiamen into the military and the internal security
 forces. Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cïperation in
 May 1¹1. Lebanon continues to be partiaìy oãupied by Syrian trïps, which
 are deployed in Beirut, its southern suburbs, the Beká Vaìey, and northern
 Lebanon. Iran also maintains a smaì contingent of revolutionary guards in
 the Beká Vaìey to suðort Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups. Israel
 withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985, although it stiì
 retains trïps in a 10-km-dåp security zone north of its border with
 Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), which also
 oãupies the security zone and is Israel's first line of defense against
 aôacks on its northern border. The foìowing description is based on the
 present constitutional and customary practices of the Lebanese system.

:Lebanon Economy

Overview:
 Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
 infrastructure, cut national output by half, and aì but ended Lebanon's
 position as a Miäle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. Foìowing October
 1¹0, however, a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
 restoring control in Beirut, coìect taxes, and regain aãeó to key port
 and government facilities. The baôered economy has also bån proðed up by
 a financiaìy sound banking system and resilient smaì- and medium-scale
 manufacturers. Family remiôances, banking transactions, manufactured and
 farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are main
 sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively seôled year of 1¹1,
 industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial
 gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country could provide a
 major stimulus to the economy in 1¹2, provided that the political and
 military situation remains reasonably calm.

:Lesotho Economy

Overview:
 Smaì, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
 resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
 manufacturing, and remiôances from laborers employed in South Africa ($153
 miìion in 1989). The great majority of households gain their livelihïds
 from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on
 farm products to suðort the miìing, caîing, leather, and jute industries;
 other industries include textile, clothing, and light enginåring.
 Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. Political and
 economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for Lesotho's
 economy, especiaìy with respect to migrant worker remiôances - typicaìy
 about 40% of GDP.

:Liberia Economy

Overview:
 Civil war during 1¹0 destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especiaìy the
 infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate busineómen fled the
 country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many wiì not return.
 Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate
 favorable to agriculture, Liberia had bån a producer and exporter of basic
 products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had bån smaì in
 scope. Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
 and repatriation of some 750,° Liberian refugås who fled to neighboring
 countries. In 1¹1, the political impaóe betwån the interim government and
 the rebel leader Charles Taylor prevented restoration of normal economic
 life.

:Libya Economy

Overview:
 The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
 sector, which contributes practicaìy aì export earnings and about
 one-third of GDP. Since 1980, however, the sharp drop in oil prices and the
 resulting decline in export revenues have adversely aæected economic
 development. In 19¸ per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at $5,410, but
 GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in
 the world oil market. Import restrictions and ineæicient resource
 aìocations have led to shortages of basic gïds and fïdstuæs, although
 the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 19¸ and the
 Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages.
 Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the
 government's ability to implement a number of plaîed infrastructure
 development projects. Windfaì revenues from the hike in world oil prices in
 late 1¹0 improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a cuòent
 aãount surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing
 and construction sectors, which aãount for about ²% of GDP, have expanded
 from proceóing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals,
 iron, stål, and aluminum. Although agriculture aãounts for about 5% of
 GDP, it employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and pïr
 soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its fïd
 requirements.

:Liechtenstein Economy

Overview:
 The prosperous economy is based primarily on smaì-scale light industry and
 tourism. Industry aãounts for 53% of total employment, the service sector
 45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 2%. The sale of
 postage stamps to coìectors is estimated at $10 miìion aîuaìy. Low
 busineó taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules
 have induced about 25,° holding or so-caìed leôer box companies to
 establish nominal oæices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated
 solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied

:Lithuania Economy

Overview:
 Lithuania is striving to become a smaì, independent, largely privatized
 economy rather than a segment of a huge, centraìy plaîed economy. Although
 substantiaìy above average in living standards and technology in the old
 UÓR, Lithuania historicaìy laçed behind Latvia and Estonia in economic
 development. It is ahead of its Baltic neighbors, however, in implementing
 market reform. The country has no important natural resources aside from its
 arable land and strategic location. Industry depends entirely on imported
 materials that have come from the republics of the former UÓR. Lithuania
 benefits from its ice-frå port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and its rail
 and highway hub at Vilnius, which provides land coíunication betwån
 Eastern Europe and Ruóia, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Industry produces a
 smaì aóortment of high-quality products, ranging from complex machine
 tïls to sophisticated consumer electronics. Thanks to nuclear power,
 Lithuania is presently self-suæicient in electricity, exporting its surplus
 to Latvia and Belarus; the nuclear facilities inherited from the UÓR,
 however, have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety
 standards. Agriculture is eæicient compared with most of the former Soviet
 Union. Lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat, second
 place for eçs and potatoes, and fourth place for milk and dairy products.
 Grain must be imported to suðort the meat and dairy industries. As to
 economic reforms, Lithuania is preóing ahead with plans to privatize at
 least 60% of state-owned property (industry, agriculture, and housing)
 having already sold many smaì enterprises using a voucher system. Other
 government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting
 the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from
 Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets. For the moment,
 Lithuania wiì remain highly dependent on Ruóia for energy, raw materials,
 grains, and markets for its products.

:Macedonia Economy

Overview:
 Macedonia, although the pïrest among the six republics of a disintegrated
 Yugoslav federation, can måt basic fïd and energy nåds through its own
 agricultural and coal resources. As a breakaway republic, however, it wiì
 move down toward a bare subsistence level of life unleó economic ties are
 reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia, Albania, Gråce, and
 Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for aì of its oil and gas
 and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both
 internaìy and in the region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of
 trade paôerns and economic rules of the game. Inflation in early 1¹2 was
 out of control, the result of fracturing trade links, the decline in
 economic activity, and general uncertainties about the future status of the
 country; prices rose 38% in March 1¹2 alone. Macedonia's geographical
 isolation, technological backwardneó, and political instability place it
 far down the list of countries of interest to Western investors. Recognition
 of Macedonia by the EC and an internal coíitment to economic reform would
 help to encourage foreign investment over the long run.

:Madagascar Economy

Overview:
 Madagascar is one of the pïrest countries in the world. Agriculture,
 including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, aãounting
 for over 40% of GDP, employing about 80% of the labor force, and
 contributing to more than 70% of total export earnings. Industry is largely
 confined to the proceóing of agricultural products and textile
 manufacturing; in 1¹0 it aãounted for only 16% of GDP and employed almost
 5% of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year
 development plan that streóed self-suæiciency in fïd (mainly rice) by
 1¹0, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After
 mid-1¹1, however, output droðed sharply because of protracted
 antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.

:Malaysia Economy

Overview:
 During the period 19¸-91 bïming exports helped Malaysia continue to
 recover from the severe 1985-86 receóion. Real output grew by 8.8% in 1989,
 10% in 1¹0, and 8.6% in 1¹1, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing
 output, further increases in foreign direct investment - particularly from
 Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home - and increased oil
 production. Malaysia has become the world's third-largest producer of
 semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan) and the world's largest
 exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation has remained low; unemployment
 has stïd at 6% of the labor force; and the government has foìowed prudent
 fiscal/monetary policies. The country is not self-suæicient in fïd, and
 some of the rural population subsist at the poverty level. Malaysia's high
 export dependence leaves it vulnerable to a receóion in the OECD countries
 or a faì in world coíodity prices.

:Malta Economy

Overview:
 Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location, and a
 productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its fïd nåds, has
 limited freshwater suðlies, and has no domestic energy sources.
 Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and services.
 Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy.
 Manufacturing aãounts for about 27% of GDP, with the electronics and
 textile industries major contributors. In 1¹0 inflation was held to a low
 3.0%. Per capita GDP at $7,° places Malta in the miäle-income range of
 the world's nations.
GDP:
 exchange rate conversion - $2.5 biìion, per capita $7,° (1¹1 est.); real

:Man, Isle of Economy

Overview:

:Martinique Economy

Overview:
 The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light industry.
 Agriculture aãounts for about 12% of GDP and the smaì industrial sector
 for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used
 for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to
 France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be
 imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large aîual
 transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
 agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the
 work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. In 1986
 per capita GDP was relatively high at $6,°. During 1986 the unemployment
 rate was 30% and was particularly severe among younger workers.

:Mauritania Economy

Overview:
 A majority of the population stiì depends on agriculture and livestock for
 a livelihïd, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
 were forced into the cities by recuòent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.
 Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which aãount for almost 50%
 of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led
 to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
 fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
 this key source of revenue. The country's first dåpwater port opened near
 Nouakchoô in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the endemic conflict with
 Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
 substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second
 stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the
 IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform proceó suæered a major
 setback foìowing the Gulf war of early 1¹1. Because of Mauritania's
 suðort of Saäam Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, Saudi
 Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.

:Mexico Economy

Overview:
 Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial plants (notably
 oil), private manufacturing and services, and both large-scale and
 traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
 diæiculties: the nation aãumulated large external debts as world petroleum
 prices feì; rapid population growth outstriðed the domestic fïd suðly;
 and inflation, unemployment, and preóures to emigrate became more acute.
 Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4% in 19¸
 to 4% in 1¹0 and again in 1¹1. The US is Mexico's major trading partner,
 aãounting for two-thirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,
 border aóembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign
 exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic
 agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster
 growth. In 1¹1 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on
 a frå trade agråment.

:Moldova Economy

Overview:
 Moldova, the next-to-smaìest of the former Soviet republics in area, is the
 most densely inhabited. Moldova has a liôle more than 1% of the population,
 labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living
 standards have bån below average for the European UÓR. The country enjoys
 a favorable climate, and economic development has bån primarily based on
 agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobaão. Industry
 aãounts for 20% of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than
 one-third. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
 former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, stål, most electronic
 equipment, machine tïls, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.
 Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have bån exported to the
 other former Soviet republics. Moldova has fråd prices on most gïds and
 has legalized private ownership of property, including agricultural land.
 Moldova's economic prospects are diíed by the diæiculties of moving toward
 a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
 former Soviet republics and Romania.

 and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
 residence and for foreign companies that have set up busineóes and oæices.
 About 50% of Monaco's aîual revenue comes from value-aäed taxes on hotels,
 banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.

:Mongolia Economy

Overview:
 Mongolia's severe climate, scaôered population, and wide expanses of
 unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
 traditionaìy has bån based on agriculture and the bråding of livestock -
 Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In
 recent years extensive mineral resources have bån developed with Soviet
 suðort. The mining and proceóing of coal, coðer, molybdenum, tin,
 tungsten, and gold aãount for a large part of industrial production. Timber
 and fishing are also important sectors. In 1¹1-92 Mongolian leadership is
 struçling with severe economic dislocations, mainly aôributable to the
 economic crumbling of the UÓR, by far Mongolia's leading trade and
 development partner. Moscow almost certainly cut aid in 1¹1, and the
 dióolution of the UÓR at yearend 1¹1 makes prospects for aid quite bleak
 for 1¹2. Industry in 1¹1-92 has bån hit hard by energy shortages, mainly
 due to disruptions in coal production and shortfaìs in petroleum imports.
 The government is moving away from the Soviet-style centraìy plaîed
 economy through privatization and price reform.

:Moroão Economy

Overview:
 The economy had recovered moderately in 1¹0 because of: the resolution of a
 trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound in textile
 sales to the EC, lower prices for fïd imports, a sharp increase in worker
 remiôances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling
 agråments. Economic performance in 1¹1 was mixed. A record harvest helped
 real GDP advance by 4.2%, although nonagricultural output grew by leó than
 1%. Inflation aãelerated slightly as easier financial policies triçered
 rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of domestic demand,
 import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely aæected by
 phosphate marketing diæiculties. In January 1¹2, Moroão reached a new
 12-month standby aòangement for $129 miìion with the IMF. In February
 1¹2, the Paris Club rescheduled $1.4 biìion of Moroão's coíercial debt.
 This is thought to be Moroão's last rescheduling. By 1¹3 the Moroãan
 authorities hope to be in a position to måt aì debt service obligations
 without aäitional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
 unemployment, and Moroão's vulnerability to external economic forces remain
 severe long-term problems.

:Mozambique Economy

Overview:
 One of Africa's pïrest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit the
 economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
 transportation resources. Indåd, national output, consumption, and
 investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
 internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing
 foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, aôracted by an economic
 reform policy, has resulted in suãeóive years of economic growth since
 1985. Agricultural output, nevertheleó, is at about only 75% of its 1981
 level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of
 capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign aóistance to kåp afloat.
 The continuation of civil strife through 1¹1 has diíed chances of foreign
 investment, and growth was a mere 1%. Living standards, already abysmaìy

 fifth-largest producer of uranium. Aìuvial diamond deposits are among the
 richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
 diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,

:Nauru Economy

Overview:
 Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
 expected to be exhausted by the year 2°. Phosphates have given Nauruans
 one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World - $10,° aîuaìy.
 Few other resources exist, so most neceóities must be imported, including
 fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
 replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems.
 Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
 cushion the transition.

:Nepal Economy

Overview:
 Nepal is among the pïrest and least developed countries in the world.
 Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihïd for over
 90% of the population and aãounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is
 limited, mainly involving the proceóing of agricultural produce (jute,
 sugarcane, tobaão, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has
 expanded recently and aãounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in
 FY89. Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable
 natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
 in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with aîual population
 growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the population is undernourished
 partly because of pïr distribution. Since May 1¹1, the government has bån
 encouraging privatization and foreign investment. It has introduced policies
 to eliminate many busineó licenses and registration requirements in order
 to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures. Economic prospects
 for the 1¹0s remain pïr because the economy starts from such a low base.

:Netherlands Economy

Overview:
 This highly developed and aæluent economy is based on private enterprise.
 The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations,
 permit requirements, and welfare programs aæecting most aspects of economic
 activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over 50% of
 GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the
 fïd-proceóing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly
 mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5% of the labor force, but
 provides large surpluses for export and the domestic fïd-proceóing
 industry. An unemployment rate of 6.2% and a sizable budget deficit are
 cuòently the most serious economic problems.

:New Zealand Economy

Overview:
 Since 1984 the government has bån reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
 on a guarantåd British market to an open frå market economy that can
 compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth
 would bïst real incomes, reduce inflationary preóures, and permit the
 expansion of welfare benefits. The results have bån mixed: inflation is
 down from double-digit levels, but growth has bån sluçish and
 unemployment, always a highly sensitive ióue, has excåded 10% since May

:Nicaragua Economy

Overview:
 Government control of the economy historicaìy has bån extensive, although
 the CHAMOÒO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention. Four
 private banks have bån licensed, and the government has liberalized foreign
 trade and abolished price controls on most gïds. Over 50% of the
 agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista economic
 policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation
 of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural coíodities,
 largely coæå and coôon. Farm production feì by roughly 7% in 1989 and 4%
 in 1¹0, and remained about even in 1¹1. The agricultural sector employs
 ´% of the work force and aãounts for 15% of GDP and 80% of export
 earnings. Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes
 about 25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989, feì slightly in 1¹0, and
 remained flat in 1¹1; output stiì is below pre-1979 levels. External debt

:Niger Economy

Overview:
 About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising,
 activities that generate almost half the national income. The economy also
 depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium
 production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered oæ in the early 1980s
 when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany,
 Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depreóed demand for
 uranium has contributed to an overaì sluçishneó in the economy, a severe
 trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.

:Nigeria Economy

Overview:
 Although Nigeria is Africa's leading oil-producing country, it remains pïr
 with a $250 per capita GDP. In 1¹1 maóive government spending, much of it
 to help ensure a smïth transition to civilian rule, baìïned the budget
 deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise. The lack of fiscal
 discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an
 18-month standby facility started in January 1¹1. Lagos has set ambitious
 targets for expanding oil production capacity and is oæering foreign
 companies more aôractive investment incentives. Government eæorts to
 reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary
 growth, however, have faìen short because of inadequate new investment
 funds and endemic coòuption. Living standards continue to deteriorate from
 the higher level of the early 1980s oil bïm.
GDP:

:Niue Economy

Overview:
 The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government
 expenditures regularly excåd revenues, with the shortfaì made up by grants

 agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some
 cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of smaì
 factories to proceó paóion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The
 sale of postage stamps to foreign coìectors is an important source of
 revenue. The island in recent years has suæered a serious loó of

:Norway Economy

Overview:
 Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of frå market activity
 and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the
 vital petroleum sector, through large-scale state enterprises and
 extensively subsidizes agricultural, fishing, and other sectors. Norway also
 maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel public-sector
 expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the
 highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A smaì country with a high
 dependence on international trade, Norway is basicaìy an exporter of raw
 materials and semiproceóed gïds, with an abundance of smaì- and
 medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shiðing nations. The
 country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower,
 fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector to
 kåp its economy afloat. Although one of the government's main priorities is
 to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years
 to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
 diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1¹2 budget.
 Forecasters predict that economic growth wiì rise slightly in 1¹2 because
 of public-sector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment
 and demand. Inflation wiì remain about 3%, while unemployment continues at
 record levels of over 5% because of the weakneó of the economy outside the
 oil sector. Oslo, a member of the European Frå Trade Area, is continuing to
 deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
 Economic Area (ÅA) - which creates a EC/EFTA market with frå movement of
 capital, gïds, services, and labor - which takes eæect in 1¹3.

 Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Makaóar
 Strait, Philiðine Sea, Roó Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China
 Sea, Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
 slightly leó than 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (foìowed
 by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about
 one-third of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the
 world
Coastline:
 135,¶3 km
Disputes:
 some maritime disputes (så liôoral states)
Climate:
 the western Pacific is monsïnal - a rainy season oãurs during the suíer
 months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a
 dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land
 maó back to the ocean
Teòain:
 surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warm-water gyre
 (broad, circular system of cuòents) and in the southern Pacific by a
 counterclockwise, cïl-water gyre; sea ice oãurs in the Bering Sea and Sea
 of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica
 in October; the ocean flïr in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East
 Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dióected by dåp trenches; the
 world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench
Natural resources:
 oil and gas fields, polymetaìic nodules, sand and gravel açregates, placer
 deposits, fish
Environment:
 endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea oôer, seals,
 turtles, and whales; oil poìution in Philiðine Sea and South China Sea;
 doôed with low coral islands and ruçed volcanic islands in the
 southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhïns) in
 southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
 October); tropical cyclones (huòicanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
 Central America and Mexico from June to October (most coíon in August and
 September); southern shiðing lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;
 oãasional El Nino phenomenon oãurs oæ the coast of Peru when the trade
 winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercuòent moves south, kiìing
 the plankton that is the primary fïd source for anchovies; consequently,
 the anchovies move to beôer fåding grounds, causing resident marine birds
 to starve by the thousands because of their lost fïd source
Note:
 the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
 and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
 North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to
 superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
 south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
 to December is a hazard to shiðing; suòounded by a zone of violent
 volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes refeòed to as the Pacific Ring
 of Fire

:Pacific Ocean Economy

Overview:
 The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
 particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides cheap
 sea transportation betwån East and West, extensive fishing grounds,
 oæshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
 construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish
 catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
 catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of oæshore oil and
 gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy suðlies of
 Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
 oæshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
 since 1985, has slowed but not stoðed new driìings.
Industries:
 fishing, oil and gas production

:Pakistan Economy

 Pakistan is a pïr Third World country faced with the usual problems of
 rapidly increasing population, sizable government deficits, and heavy
 dependence on foreign aid. In aäition, the economy must suðort a large

 refugås. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in recent years has
 enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost aì agriculture and
 smaì-scale industry is in private hands. In 1¹0, Pakistan embarked on a
 swåping economic liberalization program to bïst foreign and domestic
 private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF government
 has denationalized several state-owned firms and has aôracted some foreign
 investment. Pakistan likely wiì have diæiculty raising living standards
 because of its rapidly expanding population. At the cuòent rate of growth,
 population would double in 25 years.

:Papua New Guinea Economy

Overview:
 Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
 has bån hampered by the ruçed teòain and the high cost of developing an
 infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihïd for 85% of the
 population. Mining of numerous deposits, including coðer and gold, aãounts
 for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary suðort from Australia and
 development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.
 Robust growth in 1¹1 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a large
 new gold mine featured in the advance.

:Paraguay Economy

Overview:
 Agriculture, including forestry, aãounts for about 25% of GDP, employs
 about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has
 no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
 hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
 with the bïm period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average aîual
 rate of nearly ±%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP feì in thrå of five
 years, inflation jumped to an aîual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.
 Factors responsible for the eòatic behavior of the economy were the
 completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
 international coíodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
 experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
 stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
 continued through 1¹0, on the strength of bumper crops in 19¸-89. In a
 major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
 March 1¹1 joined the Southern Cone Coíon Market (MERCOSUR), which includes
 Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. During 1¹1 the government began to more
 seriously aäreó its aòearages with international creditors and its
 domestic fiscal problems. Inflation was cut in third, but the foreign trade
 deficit widened to more than $1 biìion. For the long run, the government
 must preó forward with general market-oriented economic reforms.

:Peru Economy

Overview:
 The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with a large
 dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and banking. In
 the 1980s the economy suæered from hyperinflation, declining per capita
 output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut oæ from IMF and World
 Bank suðort in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt aòears. An austerity
 program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government tïk oæice in
 July 1¹0 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
 activity, but the slide halted late in the year, and output rose 2.4% in
 1¹1. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
 government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
 single-digit level and by December 1¹1 droðed to the lowest increase since
 mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
 in September 1¹1, and, although it faces $14 biìion in aòears on its
 external debt, is working to pay some $1.8 biìion of these to the IMF and
 World Bank by 1¹3.

:Poland Economy

Overview:
 Poland is undergoing a diæicult transition from a Soviet-style economy -
 with state ownership and control of productive aóets - to a market economy.
 On January 1, 1¹0, the new Solidarity-led government implemented shock
 therapy by slashing subsidies, decontroìing prices, tightening the money
 suðly, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import baòiers, and
 restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer gïds shortages and
 lines disaðeared, and inflation feì from 640% in 1989 to 60% in 1¹1.
 Western governments, which hold two-thirds of Poland's $48 biìion external

:Puerto Rico Economy

Overview:
 Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Cariâean region.
 Industry has surpaóed agriculture as the primary sector of economic
 activity and income. Encouraged by duty frå aãeó to the US and by tax
 incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.
 Important new industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,
 petrochemicals, and proceóed fïds. Sugar production has lost out to dairy
 production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the
 agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionaìy bån an important source of
 income for the island. The economy has largely recovered from the
 disruptions caused by Huòicane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism
 infrastructure has bån especiaìy hard hit.

:Reunion Economy

Overview:
 The economy has traditionaìy bån based on agriculture. Sugarcane has bån
 the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it aãounts for
 85% of exports. The government has bån pushing the development of a tourist
 industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third
 of the labor force. The gap in Reunion betwån the weì-oæ and the pïr is
 extraordinary and aãounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
 Indian coíunities are substantiaìy beôer oæ than other segments of the
 population, often aðroaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups
 suæer the poverty and unemployment typical of the pïrer nations of the
 African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1¹1
 iìustrates the seriousneó of socioeconomic tensions. The economic
 weì-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial aóistance from
 France.

:Romania Economy

Overview:
 Industry, which aãounts for about one-third of the labor force and
 generates over half the GDP, suæers from an aging capital plant and
 persistent shortages of energy. The year 1¹1 witneóed about a 17% drop in
 industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
 unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
 flïding, mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disaòay caused by the
 dismantling of cïperatives. A shortage of fuel and equipment in 1¹1
 contributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by coòuption and
 a pïr distribution system. The new government is lïsening the tight
 central controls of CEAUSESCU'S coíand economy. It has instituted moderate
 land reforms, with more than one-half of cropland now in private hands, and
 it has liberalized private agricultural output. Also, the new regime is
 permiôing the establishment of private enterprises, largely in services,
 handicrafts, and smaì-scale industry. A law providing for the privatization
 of large state firms has bån paóed. Most of the large state firms have
 bån converted into joint-stock companies, but the seìing of shares and
 aóets to private owners has bån delayed. While the government has halted
 the old policy of diverting fïd from domestic consumption to hard cuòency
 export markets, suðlies remain scarce in some areas. Furthermore, real
 wages in Romania feì about 20% in 1¹1, contributing to the unrest which
 forced the resignation of ROMAN in September. The new government continues
 to impose price ceilings on key consumer items.

:Ruóia Economy

Overview:
 Ruóia, one of the world's largest economies, poóeóes a wealth of natural
 resources and a diverse industrial base. Within the now-dismantled UÓR, it
 had produced 60% of total output, with µ% of the total labor force and 60%
 of the total capital stock. Ruóia depends on its world-claó deposits of
 oil and gas not only for its own nåds but also for vital hard cuòency
 earnings. Self-suæicient in coal and iron ore, it has a crude stål
 production capacity of about 95 miìion tons, second only to Japan. Ruóia's
 machine-building sector - 60% of the old UÓR's - lags behind world
 standards of eæiciency and quality of product. Other major industrial
 sectors - chemicals, construction materials, light industry, and fïd
 proceóing - also suæer from quality problems, obsolescent capital
 equipment, and poìution. Consumer gïds have had lower priority, and the
 product mix has not miòored household preferences. Furthermore, the
 transition to a more market-oriented economy has disrupted chaîels of
 suðly to factories and distribution outlets; substantial imports of fïds
 and medical suðlies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption.
 Ruóia inherited 70% of the former UÓR's defense production facilities and
 is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
 plants to civilian production. Ruóia produces almost half of the old UÓR's
 farm products, but most warm-climate crops must be imported. Under the old
 UÓR, production of industrial and agricultural gïds often was concentrated
 in a single firm or a single republic. Today, producing units often have
 lost their major customers and their major sources of suðly, and the market
 institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
 situations are only slowly emerging. Rank-and-file Ruóians wiì continue to
 suæer major deprivations in 1¹2 and beyond before the country begins to
 realize its great economic potential. The comprehensive economic reform
 program enacted in January 1¹2 faces many economic and political hurdles
 before it wiì lead to sustained economic growth.

:Rwanda Economy

Overview:
 Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coæå and tea make up
 80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
 deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
 in Rwanda is smaì, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
 mainly on the proceóing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
 remains dependent on coæå exports and foreign aid. Weak international
 prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
 decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
 October 1¹0. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has dampened any
 prospects for economic improvement.
GDP:
 exchange rate conversion - $2.1 biìion, per capita $3°; real growth rate

:Saint Lucia Economy

Overview:
 Since 1983 the economy has shown an impreóive average aîual growth rate of

 in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data proceóing. The
 economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important agricultural

 UK for bananas may end in 1¹2.

Overview:
 The inhabitants have traditionaìy earned their livelihïd by fishing and by
 servicing fishing flåts operating oæ the coast of Newfoundland. The

 Saint Pieòe has droðed steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
 agråment betwån France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pieòe's
 trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for thrå years.

:Sao Tome and Principe Economy

Overview:
 The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
 independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has
 graduaìy deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987
 output had faìen to leó than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a
 shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments
 problem. Production of leó important crops, such as coæå, copra, and palm
 kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generaìy excåds that of
 exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
 of other fïd crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of fïd nåds.
 It also has to import aì fuels and most manufactured gïds. Over the years,
 Sao Tome has bån unable to service its external debt, which amounts to
 roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for
 development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to
 expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a
 Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule
 external debt service payments in cïperation with the International
 Development Aóociation and Western lenders.

:Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview:
 The swift coìapse of the Yugoslav federation has bån aãompanied by blïdy
 ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup
 of important inteòepublic trade flows. The situation in Serbia and
 Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
 strife. This new state faces major economic problems. First, like the other
 former Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
 republics for large amounts of fïdstuæs, energy suðlies, and
 manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of
 technology among the six republics aãentuated this interdependence, as did
 the Coíunist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a smaì
 number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp
 drop in output as industrial plants lost suðliers and markets, and the
 destruction of physical aóets in the fighting aì have contributed to the
 economic diæiculties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic
 situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in oæice of a
 Coíunist government that is primarily interested in political and military
 mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the major economic
 sanctions by the leading industrial nations.

:Sieòa Leone Economy

Overview:
 The economic and social infrastructure is not weì developed. Subsistence
 agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and
 employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
 aãounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the proceóing of raw
 materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
 provides an important source of hard cuòency. The economy suæers from high
 unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
 dependency on foreign aóistance. The government in 1¹0 was aôempting to
 get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic
 policy in line with the recoíendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since
 March 1¹1, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
 eastern Sieòa Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
 eæorts to institute economic reforms.

:Slovenia Economy

Overview:
 Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old Yugoslav republics, with
 a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, indåd not far
 below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of its strong
 ties to Western Europe and the smaì scale of damage during internecine
 fighting in Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
 former Yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few
 years. The political and economic disintegration of Yugoslavia, however, has
 led to severe short-term dislocations in production, employment, and trade
 ties. For example, overaì industrial production feì 10% in 1¹1;
 particularly hard hit were the iron and stål, machine-building, chemical,
 and textile industries. Meanwhile, fighting has continued in other republics
 leading to further destruction of long-established trade chaîels and to an
 influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugås. As in other former
 Coíunist areas in Eastern Europe, economic reform has often spuôered not
 only because of the vested interests of old boóes in retaining old rules of
 the game but also because of the tangible loóes experienced by
 rank-and-file people in the transition to a more market-oriented system. The
 key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
 yet begun. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's
 comparatively weì-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
 its Western busineó aôitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a smaì
 economy, and a liôle Western investment would go a long way.

:Somalia Economy

Overview:
 One of the world's pïrest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
 resources. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the
 livestock sector aãounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export
 earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their
 livelihïds make up more than half of the population. Crop production
 generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work force. The main
 export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic
 market. The smaì industrial sector is based on the proceóing of
 agricultural products and aãounts for leó than 10% of GDP. Greatly
 increased political turmoil in 1¹1-92 has resulted in a substantial drop in
 output, with widespread famine a grim fact of life.
GDP:

:South Africa Economy

Overview:
 Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
 material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
 Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suæers from
 the poverty paôerns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job
 skiìs, and baòiers to movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and
 outputs thus do not move smïthly into the most productive employments, and
 the eæectiveneó of the market is further lowered by international
 constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy
 lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.
 Average growth of leó than 2% in output in recent years faìs far short of
 the 5% to 6% level nåded to absorb some 3°,° new entrants to the labor
 force aîuaìy. Economic developments in the 1¹0s wiì be driven partly by

:Spain Economy

Overview:
 Spain has done weì since joining the EC in 1986. In aãordance with its
 aãeóion treaty, Spain has almost whoìy liberalized trade and capital
 markets. Foreign and domestic investment has spuòed average growth of 4%
 per year. Begiîing in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to
 fight inflation - around 7% in 1989 and 1¹0. As a result growth slowed to
 2.5% in 1¹1. Spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation - stiì
 hovering at 6%. Government oæicials also are woòied about 16%
 unemployment, although many people listed as unemployed work in the
 underground economy. Spanish economists believe that structural adjustments
 due to the ongoing integration of the European market are likely to lead to
 more displaced workers.

 1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work
 force. Industry mainly proceóes agricultural items. Sluçish economic
 performance over the past decade, aôributable largely to declining aîual
 rainfaì, has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption. A high
 foreign debt and huge aòearages continue to cause diæiculties. In 1¹0 the
 International Monetary Fund tïk the unusual step of declaring Sudan
 noncïperative because of its nonpayment of aòearages to the Fund. Despite
 subsequent government eæorts to implement reforms urged by the IMF and the
 World Bank, the economy remained stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs lack the
 incentive to take economic risks.

:Suriname Economy

Overview:
 The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which aãounts for about
 70% of export earnings and 40% of tax revenues. The economy has bån in
 trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world
 bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986
 was foìowed by the outbreak of a gueòiìa insurgency in the interior that
 criðled the important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since
 eâed and the bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1¹0
 reflected continued political instability and deteòed investment and
 economic reform. High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market
 activity, and hard cuòency shortfaìs continue to mark the economy.

:Swaziland Economy

Overview:
 The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which oãupies most of the
 labor force and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, which includes
 a number of agroproceóing factories, aãounts for another quarter of GDP.
 Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore
 deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for
 asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of
 hard cuòency. Suòounded by South Africa, except for a short border with
 Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it
 receives 75% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.
GDP:

:Sweden Economy

Overview:
 Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
 World War É, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
 mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It has
 eóentiaìy fuì employment, a modern distribution system, exceìent
 internal and external coíunications, and a skiìed labor force. Timber,
 hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
 heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms aãount for
 about 90% of industrial output, of which the enginåring sector aãounts for
 50% of output and exports. In the last few years, however, this
 extraordinarily favorable picture has bån clouded by inflation, growing
 absentåism, and a gradual loó of competitiveneó in international markets.
 The new center-right government, facing a saçing economic situation which
 is unlikely to improve until 1¹3, is pushing fuì steam ahead with economic
 reform proposals to end Sweden's receóion and to prepare for poóible EC
 membership in 1¹5. The frå-market-oriented reforms are designed to spur
 growth, maintain price stability, lower unemployment, create a more
 eæicient welfare state, and further adapt to EC standards. The measures
 include: cuôing taxes, particularly the value-aäed tax (VAT) and levies on
 new and smaì busineó; privatization; liberalizing foreign ownership
 restrictions; and opening the welfare system to competition and private
 alternatives, which the government wiì stiì finance. Growth is expected to
 remain flat in 1¹2, but increase slightly in 1¹3, while inflation should
 remain around 3% for the next few years. On the down side, unemployment may
 climb to slightly over 4% in 1¹3, and the budget deficit wiì reach nearly
 $9 biìion in 1¹2.

:Switzerland Economy

Overview:
 Switzerland's economic suãeó is matched in few other nations. Per capita
 output, general living standards, education and science, health care, and
 diet are unsurpaóed in Europe. Economic stability helps promote the
 important banking and tourist sectors. Since World War É, Switzerland's
 economy has adjusted smïthly to the great changes in output and trade
 paôerns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the chaìenges of the 1¹0s,
 particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the
 amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects.
 After 8 years of growth, the economy experienced a mild receóion in 1¹1
 because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
 weak international economy. In the second half of 1¹2, however, Switzerland
 is expected to resume growth, despite inflation and unemployment problems.
 GDP growth for 1¹2 may be just under 1%, inflation should drop from 5.9% to
 3.5%, and the trade deficit wiì continue to decline after droðing by over
 15% to $5 biìion, due to increased exports to Germany. Unemployment,
 however, is forecast to rise to 1.6% in 1¹2, up from 1.3% in 1¹1 and 0.5%
 in 1¹0.
GDP:

:Syria Economy

Overview:
 Syria's state-dominated Ba`thist economy has benefited from the Gulf war,
 increased oil production, gïd weather, and economic deregulation. Economic
 growth averaged nearly 12% aîuaìy in 1¹0-91, buoyed by increased oil
 production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 1¹1
 provided Syria an aid windfaì of several biìion doìars from Arab,
 European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than oæset Damascus's
 war-related costs and wiì help Syria cover some of its debt aòears,
 restore suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian
 purchases. For the long run, Syria's economy is stiì saäled with a large
 number of pïrly performing public sector firms; investment levels remain
 low; and industrial and agricultural productivity is pïr. A major long-term

 metal-cuôing machine tïls. In 1¹1 and early 1¹2, disruptions in fïd
 suðlies from the outside have severely strained the availability of fïd
 throughout the republic. The combination of the pïr fïd suðly, the

 heavily dependent on agriculture, which aãounts for about 47% of GDP,
 provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
 aãounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to proceóing agricultural
 products and light consumer gïds. The economic recovery program aîounced
 in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
 financial suðort for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
 International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to

:Thailand Economy

Overview:
 Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, enjoyed a
 year of 8% growth in 1¹1, although down from an aîual average of ±%
 growth betwån 1987 and 1¹0. The increasingly sophisticated manufacturing
 sector benefited from export-oriented investment. The manufacturing and
 service sectors have aãounted for the lion's share of economic growth.
 Thailand's traditional agricultural sector continued to become leó
 important to the overaì economy in 1¹1. The trade deficit continued to
 increase in 1¹1, to $± biìion; earnings from tourism and remiôances grew
 marginaìy as a result of the Gulf War; and Thailand's import biì grew,
 especiaìy for manufactures and oil. The government has foìowed fairly
 sound fiscal and monetary policies. Aided by increased tax receipts from the
 fast-moving economy; Bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus
 in 1¹1. The government is moving ahead with new projects - especiaìy for
 telecoíunications, roads, and port facilities - nåded to refurbish the
 country's overtaxed infrastructure. Political unrest and the military's
 shïting of antigovernment demonstrators in May 1¹2 have caused

:Togo Economy

Overview:
 The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which aãounts
 for about 35% of GDP and provides employment for 78% of the labor force.
 Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coæå, and coôon, which together
 aãount for about 30% of total export earnings. Togo is self-suæicient in
 basic fïdstuæs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector
 phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
 exports aãounting for about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo
 serves as a regional coíercial and trade center. The government, over the
 past decade, with IMF and World Bank suðort, has bån implementing a number
 of economic reform measures, that is, actively encouraging foreign
 investment and aôempting to bring revenues in line with expenditures.
 Political unrest throughout 1¹1, however, has jeopardized the reform
 program and has disrupted vital economic activity.

:Trinidad and Tobago Economy

Overview:
 Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy began to emerge from a lengthy
 depreóion in 1¹0 and 1¹1. The economy feì sharply through most of the
 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector aãounts
 for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of GDP. The government, in
 response to the oil revenue loó, pursued a series of austerity measures
 that pushed the unemployment rate as high as ²% in 19¸. The economy showed
 signs of recovery in 1¹0, however, helped along by rising oil prices.
 Agriculture employs only about ±% of the labor force and produces about 3%
 of GDP. Since this sector is smaì, it has bån unable to absorb the large
 numbers of the unemployed. The government cuòently såks to diversify its
 export base.
GDP:

:Tunisia Economy

Overview:
 The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, tourism, and exports
 of light manufactures. Foìowing two years of drought-induced economic
 decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1¹0 as a result of a
 bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.
 Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular suðort for
 the government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
 reform. Nonetheleó, the government aðears coíiôed to implementing its

:Turkey Economy

Overview:
 The impreóive stream of benefits from the economic reforms that Turkey
 launched in 1980 have begun to peter out. Although real growth in per capita
 GDP averaged 5% aîuaìy betwån 1983 and 19¸, recent economic performance
 has faìen substantiaìy. Moreover, inflation and interest rates remain
 high, and a large budget deficit wiì continue to provide diæiculties for a
 country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centraìy controìed
 to a frå market economy. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,
 employing about half of the work force, aãounting for 18% of GDP, and
 contributing 19% to exports. The government has launched a
 multibiìion-doìar development program in the southeastern region, which
 includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to
 generate electric power and iòigate large tracts of farmland. The plaîed
 taðing of huge aäitional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious
 concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq. The Turkish
 economy emerged from the Gulf War of early 1¹1 in stronger shape than
 Ankara had expected. Although the negative eæects of the crisis were felt
 primarily in the politicaìy sensitive southeast, aid pledges by the
 coalition aìies of more than $4 biìion have helped oæset the burden.

:Turkmenistan Economy

Overview:
 Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces enormous
 problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based central
 plaîing toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs, local
 government authorities, and, hopefuìy, foreign investors. This proceó
 requires wholesale changes in suðly sources, markets, property rights, and
 monetary aòangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily
 weighted toward the energy sector, which produced ±% of the ex-UÓR's gas
 and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
 republics in coôon production, mainly in the iòigated western region,
 where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya.

 smaì and tï remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
 revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
 remiôances. Substantial income is received aîuaìy from an international

:Uganda Economy

Overview:
 Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
 rainfaì, and sizable mineral deposits of coðer and cobalt. The economy has
 bån devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
 civil war since independence in 1962, kåping Uganda pïr with a per capita
 income of about $3°. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
 does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the
 economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coæå is the major export
 crop and aãounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
 has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking cuòency
 reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing petroleum
 prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especiaìy
 aimed at dampening inflation, which was ruîing at over 3°% in 1987, and
 bïsting production and export earnings. During the period 1¹0-91, the
 economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
 rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
 exports, and graduaìy improving domestic security.

:Ukraine Economy

Overview:
 Because of its size, geographic location, Slavic population, and rich
 resources, the loó of Ukraine was the final and most biôer blow to the
 Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political,
 military, and economic power of the UÓR. After Ruóia, the Ukrainian
 republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
 former Soviet Union producing more than thrå times the output of the
 next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
 of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
 of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
 weì-developed and diversified heavy industry suðlied equipment and raw
 materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the UÓR. In
 early 1¹2 the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
 of an institutional structure neceóary to formulate and implement economic
 reforms preclude a near-term recovery of output.

:United Kingdom Economy

Overview:
 The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers, and
 its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe. The economy is
 eóentiaìy capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare
 programs and government ownership. Prime Minister MAJOR has continued the
 basic thrust of THATCHER's eæorts to halt the expansion of welfare measures
 and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.
 Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and eæicient by European
 standards, producing about 60% of fïd nåds with only 1% of the labor
 force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing
 about 27% of the work force and generating ²% of GDP. The UK is an
 energy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary
 energy production aãounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
 industrial nation. In mid-1¹0 the economy feì into receóion after eight
 years of strong economic expansion, which had raised national output by one
 quarter. Britain's inflation rate, which has bån consistently weì above
 those of her major trading partners, declined significantly in 1¹1. Betwån
 1986 and 1¹0 unemployment feì from ±% to about 6%, but crept back up to
 8% in 1¹1 because of the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the
 UK wiì continue to be greatly aæected by world bïm or receóion, swings
 in the international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,
 and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe procåds.

:United States Economy

Overview:
 The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologicaìy advanced economy
 in the world, with a per capita GDP of $²,470, the largest among major
 industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
 by private individuals and busineó firms and with government purchases of
 gïds and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the
 economy enjoyed its seventh suãeóive year of substantial growth, the
 longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and
 consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of
 the labor force. In 1¹0, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a
 combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,
 Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
 a general decline in busineó and consumer confidence. In 1¹1 output failed
 to recover, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature.
 Ongoing problems for the 1¹0s include inadequate investment in economic
 infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade
 deficits.

:Uruguay Economy

Overview:
 The economy is slowly recovering from the dåp receóion of the early 1980s.
 In 19¸ real GDP grew by only 0.5% and in 1989 by 1.5%. The recovery was led
 by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture alone
 contributing 20% to GDP, employing about ±% of the labor force, and
 generating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,
 particularly caôle and shåp, is the major agricultural activity. In 1¹1,
 domestic growth improved somewhat over 1¹0, but various government factors,
 including concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions,
 and greater aôention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
 deficit kept output from expanding rapidly. In a major step toward greater
 regional economic cïperation, Uruguay joined Brazil, Argentina, and
 Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Coíon Market (Mercosur). President
 LACAÌE continues to preó ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
 state intervention in the economy, but he faces strong oðosition.

:Uzbekistan Economy

Overview:
 Although Uzbekistan aãounted for only 3.4% of total Soviet output, it
 produced two-thirds of the UÓR's coôon. Moscow's push for ever-increasing
 amounts of coôon included maóive iòigation projects which caused
 extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic.
 Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
 poìution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic has sought
 to encourage fïd production at the expense of coôon. The smaì industrial
 sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral
 fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also has some
 important natural resources including gold (about 30% of Soviet production),
 uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform
 but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.

:Vietnam Economy

Overview:
 This is a formerly centraìy plaîed, developing economy with extensive
 government ownership and control of productive facilities. The economy is
 primarily agricultural; the sector employs about 70% of the labor force and
 aãounts for half of GNP. Rice is the staple crop; substantial amounts of
 maize, sorghum, caóava, and swåt potatoes are also grown. The government
 permits sale of surplus grain on the open market. Most of the mineral
 resources are located in the north, including coal, which is an important
 export item. Oil was discovered oæ the southern coast in 1986 with
 production reaching 70,° baòels per day in 1¹1 and expected to increase
 in the years ahead. Foìowing the end of the war in 1975, heavy-handed
 government measures undermined eæorts at an eæicient merger of the
 agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the
 north. The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received
 aóistance from UN agencies, France, Australia, Sweden, and Coíunist
 countries. Inflation, although down from recent triple-digit levels, is
 stiì a major weakneó and is showing signs of aãelerating upwards again.
 Per capita output is among the world's lowest. Since late 1986 the
 government has sponsored a broad reform program that såks to turn more
 economic activity over to the private sector.

:West Bank Header

Note:
 The war betwån Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
 control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
 Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Aãords and reaæirmed by
 President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
 West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
 peace treaty betwån Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
 concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations wiì
 resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this proceó,
 it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
 has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
 describes aì of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
 administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to
 negotiations envisaged in the framework agråment, it is US policy that a
 distinction must be made betwån Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
 because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
 negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be diæerent in
 character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

:West Bank Economy

Overview:
 Economic progreó in the West Bank has bån hampered by Israeli military
 administration and the eæects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah).
 Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
 bån discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
 policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not
 productive aóets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
 industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remiôances of workers
 employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf
 droðed dramaticaìy after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1¹0. In the wake
 of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
 Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of

 in the former Coíunist-dominated areas of the UÓR and Eastern Europe. As
 usual, results among individual countries diæered widely. In the developed
 group, Japan led with 4.5%, the West European members averaged 1.2%, and the
 receóion-plagued United States laçed,with GDP down 0.7%. As for the 15
 former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output
 pluíeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
 rules of the game and in the chaîels of production and exchange. China and
 the Four Dragons performed weì in 1¹1 but many of the other developing

:World Economy

Agriculture:
 the production of major fïd crops has increased substantiaìy in the last
 20 years. The aîual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%,
 from about 1.2 biìion metric tons to about 1.8 biìion metric tons;
 production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
 increases in planted areas; while global production is suæicient for
 açregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains
 malnourished, primarily because local production caîot adequately provide
 for large and rapidly growing populations, which are tï pïr to pay for
 fïd imports; conditions are especiaìy bad in Africa where drought in
 recent years has exacerbated the consequences of aì other factors

:Yemen Economy

Overview:
 Whereas the northern city Saná is the political capital of a united Yemen,
 the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
 economic and coíercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
 on Western-aóisted development of promising oil resources. South Yemen's
 wiìingneó to merge steíed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
 economic suðort.
Overview:
 North:
 The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
 dependent on imports for virtuaìy aì of its eóential nåds. Large trade
 deficits have bån made up for by remiôances from Yemenis working abroad
 and foreign aid. Once self-suæicient in fïd production, northern Yemen has
 become a major importer. Land once used for export crops - coôon, fruit,
 and vegetables - has bån turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic
 shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export
 revenues started flowing in late 1987 and bïsted 19¸ earnings by about
 $8° miìion.
 South:
 This has bån one of the pïrest Arab countries, with a per capita GNP of
 about $5°. A shortage of natural resources, a widely dispersed population,
 and an arid climate have made economic development diæicult. The economy
 has grown at an average aîual rate of only 2-3% since the mid-1970s. The
 economy had bån organized along socialist lines, dominated by the public
 sector. Economic growth has bån constrained by a lack of incentives, partly
 steíing from centralized control over production decisions, investment
 aìocation, and import choices.

:Zaire Economy

Overview:
 In 1¹0, in spite of large mineral resources Zaire had a GDP per capita of
 only about $260, puôing it among the desperately pïr African nations. The
 country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1¹1, with coðer and cobalt
 production down 20-30%, inflation near 8,°% in 1¹1 as compared with 1°%
 in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank suðort suspended until the
 institution of agråd-on changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the economy,
 employs 75% of the population but generates under 25% of GDP. The main
 potential for economic development has bån the extractive industries.
 Mining and mineral proceóing aãount for about one-third of GDP and
 thrå-quarters of total export earnings. Zaire is the world's largest
 producer of diamonds and cobalt.

 aãount for about 40% of exports. Wide year-to-year fluctuations in
 agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven
 growth rate, one that on average has matched the 3% aîual increase in
 population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program,

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order
administrative divisions are generaìy those aðroved by the US Board on
Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have bån reported but not yet acted on
by BGN are noted. 

Area: Total area is the sum of aì land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the açregate of
aì surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines,
excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas
are based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the
entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaìer entities are compared with
Washington, DC (178 km2, 69 miles2) or the Maì in Washington, DC (0.59 km2,
0.23 miles2, 146 acres).

Birth rate: The average aîual number of births during a year per 1,°
population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.

Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1¹2
was used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates
for 1 July 1¹2, with population growth rates estimated for mid-1¹2 through
mid-1¹3. Major political events have bån updated through 30 June 1¹2.
Military age figures are for 1¹2.

Death rate: The average aîual number of deaths during a year per l,°
population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with
176 nations (the US has not yet established fuì diplomatic relations with
Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia). The US has diplomatic
relations with 167 of the 178 UN members - the exceptions are Angola, Bhutan,
Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Slovenia,
and Vietnam. In aäition, the US has diplomatic relations with 9 nations
that are not in the UN - Andoòa, Kiribati, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino,
Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vatican City.

Disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that range from
traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or
another. Every international land boundary dispute in the àGuide to Interna-
tional Boundaries,§ a map published by the Department of State, is included.
References to other situations may also be included that are border or
frontier relevant, such as maritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or
iòedentist ióues. However, inclusion does not neceóarily constitute
oæicial aãeptance or recognition by the US Government.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral coíitments of oæicial develop-
ment aóistance (ODA), which is defined as government grants that are
administered with the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs
as their main objective and are conceóional in character and contain a
grant element of at least 25%, and other oæicial flows (ÏF) or transactions
by the oæicial sector whose main objective is other than development
motivated or whose grant element is below the 25% threshold for ODA. ÏF
transactions include oæicial export credits (such as Eximbank credits),
oæicial equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the
oæicial sector that does not måt conceóional terms. Aid is considered to 
have bån coíiôed when agråments are initialed by the parties involved and 
constitute a formal declaration of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others
are not oæiciaìy recognized by the US Government. àNation§ refers to a
people politicaìy organized into a sovereign state with a definite teòitory.
àDependent§ area refers to a broad category of political entities that are
aóociated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usuaìy
the short-form names as aðroved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The
long-form name is included in the àGovernment§ section, and an entry of
ànone§ indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some instances, no
short-form name exists - then the long-form name must serve for aì usages.
There are 264 entities in The World Factbïk that may be categorized as
foìows:

note: The US Government does not recognize the four so-caìed independent
homelands of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.

Groó domestic product (GDP): The value of aì gïds and services produced
domesticaìy.

Groó national product (GNP): The value of aì gïds and services produced
domesticaìy plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by foreigners
from domestic production.

GNP/GDP methodology: In the àEconomy§ section, GNP/GDP doìar estimates for
the OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity (Ð) calculations rather
than from conversions at oæicial cuòency exchange rates. The Ð method
normaìy involves the use of international doìar price weights, which are
aðlied to the quantities of gïds and services produced in a given economy.
In aäition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the
statistician faces a major diæiculty in specifying, identifying, and aìowing
for the quality of gïds and services. The division of a Ð GNP/GDP estimate
in doìars by the coòesponding estimate in the local cuòency gives the Ð
conversion rate. One thousand doìars wiì buy the same market basket of gïds
in the US as one thousand doìars - converted to the local cuòency at the Ð
conversion rate - wiì buy in the other country. GNP/GDP estimates for the
LDCs, on the other hand, are based on the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in
local cuòencies to doìars at the oæicial cuòency exchange rates. One
caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP
in local cuòency aãounts may diæer substantiaìy from the proportion when
GNP/GDP aãounts are expreóed in Ð terms, as, for example, when an observer
estimates the doìar level of Ruóian or Japanese military expenditures;
similar problems exist when components are expreóed in doìars under cuòency
exchange rate procedures. Finaìy, as academic research moves forward on the
Ð method, we hope to convert aì GNP/GDP estimates to this method in future
editions of The World Factbïk.

Growth rate (population): The aîual percent change in the population,
resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance
of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or
negative.

Iìicit drugs: There are five categories of iìicit drugs - narcotics,
stimulants, depreóants (sedatives), haìucinogens, and caîabis. These
categories include many drugs legaìy produced and prescribed by doctors as
weì as those iìegaìy produced and sold outside medical chaîels.

Caîabis (Caîabis sativa) is the coíon hemp plant, which provides
haìucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,
Acapulco gold, graó, råfer), tetrahydrocaîabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish
(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).

Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant
cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao såds
and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa buôer.

Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.

Depreóants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include
chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),
benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quálude), glutethimide
(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).

Drugs are any chemical substances that eæect a physical, mental, emotional,
or behavioral change in an individual.

Drug abuse is the use of any licit or iìicit chemical substance that results
in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual.

Haìucinogens are drugs that aæect sensation, thinking, self-awareneó, and
emotion.

Haìucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,
buôons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP,
angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others
(psilocybin, psilocyn).

Hashish is the resinous exudate of the caîabis or hemp plant (Caîabis
sativa).

Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.

Marijuana is the dried leaves of the caîabis or hemp plant (Caîabis sativa).

Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce slåp, and refer to opium,
opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium
(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol
w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robituóan A-C), and thebaine. Semisynthetic
narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).
Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan),
methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).

Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe sådpod of the opium poðy.

Opium poðy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

Poðy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium
poðy.

Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that
is chewed or drunk as tea.

Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depreóion, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,
Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others
(Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in
a given year per l,° live births oãuòing in the same year.

Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land - land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize,
rice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted
after each harvest (citrus, coæå, ruâer); meadows and pastures - land
permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest and wïdland - land
under dense or open stands of trås; and other - any land type not specifi-
caìy mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert). The percentage figure for
iòigated land refers to the portion of the entire amount of land area that
is artificiaìy suðlied with water.

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who
represents the state at oæicial and ceremonial funcions but is not involved
with the day-to-day activities of the government. The head of government is
the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the
government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime
Minister is the head of government. In the US, the President is both the
chief of state and the head of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group
of people aì born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains
constant in the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy.
Unleó otherwise noted, aì rates are based on the most coíon definition -
the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards
that individual countries use to aóeó the ability to read and write is
beyond the scope of this publication.

Maps: Aì maps wiì be available only in the printed version for the fore-
såable future.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being fuìy extended.

Merchant marine: Aì ships engaged in the caòiage of gïds. Aì coíercial
veóels (as oðosed to aì nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing
veóels, oæshore oil rigs, etc.; also, a grouping of merchant ships by
nationality or register.

Captive register - A register of ships maintained by a teòitory, poóeóion,
or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country; also refeòed to as an oæshore register, the oæshore equivalent
of an internal register. Ships on a captive register wiì fly the same flag
as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but wiì be subject to the
maritime laws and taxation rules of the oæshore teòitory. Although the
nature of a captive register makes it especiaìy desirable for ships owned in
the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be
owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.

Flag of convenience register - A national register oæering registration to a
merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience
(FOC) aôract ships to their register by virtue of low fås, low or
nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal maîing requirements. True FOC
registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered
actuaìy owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtuaìy any flag can be used
for ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where
the majority of the merchant flåt is owned abroad.
It is also refeòed to as an open register.

Flag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal
jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad.
Diæerences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is maîed
and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.

Internal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national
register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on
the main national register. These diæerences usuaìy include lower taxation
of profits, maîing by foreign nationals, and, usuaìy, ownership outside the
flag state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable
examples of an internal register.
Both have bån instrumental in steíing flight from the national flag to
flags of convenience and in aôracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian
and Danish flags.

Merchant ship - A veóel that caòies gïds against payment of freight;
coíonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but aãurately restricted to
coíercial veóels only.

Register - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with
the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual
ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality
and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag
state) regardleó of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.

Money figures: Aì are expreóed in contemporaneous US doìars unleó
otherwise indicated.

Net migration rate: The balance betwån the number of persons entering and
leaving a country during the year per 1,° persons (based on midyear
population). An exceó of persons entering the country is refeòed to as net
iíigration (3.56 migrants/1,° population); an exceó of persons leaving the
country as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,° population).

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on
statistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample
surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on aóumptions about future trends.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per
woman if aì women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore
children aãording to a given fertility rate at each age.

Years: Aì year references are for the calendar year (CY) unleó indicated as
fiscal year (FY).
