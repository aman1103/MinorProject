# Comparative Analysis of Data Compression Algorithms

This is a part of the minor project for our university coursework.

# Usage

Start by compiling files:

```
chmod +x compile.sh
./compile.sh
```

The above script will generate all the executables for the algorithm implementations.

Once done, run the Python script for getting compression-related statistics:

- If Python 3:

	```
	python3 generate_csv.py
	```		
- else:
	```
	python generate_csv.py
	```	

The script will generate CSVs for each algorithm, wherein the algorithm is ran on all the test datasets.

# Final Report

Report will be added soon.
